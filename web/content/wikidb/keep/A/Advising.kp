If you have a degree plan on file before Spring Break, you can e-mail Bold for a code. Please confirm that you intend to follow what's next on the plan.

If you do not have a degree plan yet, you will need to have a conversation with me about the next two semesters' course choices. I will give codes before and after the Group Meeting on March 23. If you cannot attend the Group Meeting, return to this page in mid-March to see what times I have set for advising appointments after March 23.
