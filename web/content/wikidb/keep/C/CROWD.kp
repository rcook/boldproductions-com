The Center for Research on Women with Disabilities (CROWD) was founded in 1992 with funding predominantly from the National Institute of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institute for Disability and Rehabilitation Research at the United States Department of Education (NIDRR).  CROWD, run by the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Baylor College of Medicine is one of the leading Centers in pioneering research and training initiatives encompassing the broad field of health, independence, and community integration as it relates to disability amongst women.  CROWD’S mission is to . . . “promote, develop, and disseminate information to expand the life choices of women with disabilities so that they may fully participate in community life. More specifically, researchers develop and evaluate models for interventions to address specific problems effecting women with disabilities” (Retrieved September 9, 2004, from http://bcm.edu/crowd/about/HISTORY.htm). The Center appeals to a large audience and focuses efforts on medical professionals, allied health professionals, counselors, social workers, educators, policy analysts, and consumers by continuing to be on the forefront of new research trends and providing an easily and readily accessible website to the public on a national level (Retrieved September 9, 2004, from http://bcm.edu/crowd/about/HISTORY.htm).<br><br>    
 
In their efforts to disseminate information, CROWD conducts a vast majority of research in the field specifically correlated to women with disabilities. Throughout the years of 1992 and 1996, a National Study of Women with Physical Disabilities was clearly one of CROWD’s greatest endeavors, researching the “Psychosocial Behaviors of Women with Physical Disabilities”. The effects were far reaching, laying the foundation for research to explore the first empirical data collection on a large population of women with physical disabilities between the adult years of 18 through 65. The results of the national study have been widely used to develop a database on psychosocial behaviors of women with physical disabilities compared with women without disabilities. More specifically, the national study found a correlation between women with disabilities and having limited opportunity to develop intimate relationships. Secondly, self-esteem was reported as being more strongly influenced by societal factors versus just simply having a disability. Another finding that the study concluded, involved the serious abuse that women with disabilities face in general, and their inability to avoid or put an end to the violence that is directed upon them. Women with physical disabilities were also reported to have the same sexual drive as women without disabilities overall; however, the difference being that women with disabilities do not have as much opportunity to have sexual relations. Finally, the study also recognized the relationship between women with disabilities and the great difficulty they experience in obtaining general and reproductive health care (Retrieved September 12, 2004, from http://www.bcm.edu/crwd/national_study/MAJORFIN.htm).<br><br>
 
The population of women with disabilities in the United States continues to rise, representing 21% of the total population of women (Retrieved on September
13, 2004, from http://www.crowdbcm.net/background.htm). “These dramatic statistics warrant expanded research and dissemination of findings on improving the health of women with disabilities” ((Retrieved on September
13, 2004, from http://www.crowdbcm.net/background.htm). CROWD provided leadership and initiative by seeking representatives (i.e. university-based researchers, and clinicians, representatives of private organizations, and representatives of federal agencies) across the field of health and science in an effort to make up a symposium to establish a research agenda for women with disabilities. The impact of this project, for all intents and purposes, was to collaborate, develop, and set goals to establish areas of need for future research on a national level. The symposium took place over a two-year period, beginning in the year 2002 and proved to be very successful. The results of the symposium are currently under construction; however, they will be available to . . . “consumers, clinicians, researchers and educators so they may be empowered to do all within their power to improve the health of women with disabilities” by end of September 2004 (Retrieved on September 13, 2004, from http://www.crowdbcm.net/fnlrpt.htm).<br><br>

CROWD is nationally recognized in the field of research among women with disabilities and strives to provide the most current and up to date studies in our ever growing and complex society.  CROWD continues to lay the groundwork for individuals to locate and access information surrounding growth and development by providing resources, websites, links, materials, and journals. Currently, nine of the Center’s staff members are individuals with disabilities. Thus, the Center takes pride in conducting research in only the most important issues at hand for their consumers (Retrieved on September 9, 2004, from http://www.bcm.edu/crowd/about/HISTORY.htm).<br><br>
