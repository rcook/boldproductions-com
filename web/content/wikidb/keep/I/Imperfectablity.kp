Daily we are surrounded with the fear of imperfectability. We do not want anyone to find fault in us, especially the citizens of America. We are so focused on the initial, facade appearance of our culture that we do not deal with the underlying factors that slowly drain us of our humanity. Various romantic poets and philosophers, such as William Wordsworth and John Passmore, have hope for some type of reform to improve human nature, but have concluded that such an attempt would be unrealistic. The attempt would only be “saddled with our flaws and deadly sins.” This fear of a permanently immoral human nature takes two forms: practical fear and what is natural is good, also called the naturalistic fallacy (p. 159, 2). Practical fear implies that human nature is unchangeable; therefore, social reformation is unnecessary. Rather, why try to change human nature if it’s not repairable? Additionally, assuming that if something is natural is good gives leeway to those who commit horrible crimes or abuses their love ones. It excuses their behavior and implies that it is okay.      
Selfishness is explicitly denied as a part of one’s human nature. To be selfish is to do away with others’ interest and opinions and to fully engulf into one’s self interest. The political implications of selfishness are applied to two major philosophies of how societies should be organized: capitalism and communism. Adam Smith, the advocate for capitalism, suggests that people will selfishly work and be paid according to their abilities as long as the labor suffices according to their needs. Karl Marx, the originator of communism and socialism, insinuates that people work because of compassion or self-actualization (p. 161, 2). Pinker reveals that followers of Marx are baffled at the suggestion that communistic behavior actually runs against our selfish nature. Very few accept the assumption that selfishness is a part of human nature. To accept selfishness as natural behavior is to imply that selfish acts such as hunting endangered species, polluting rivers, and over fishing a harbor are unavoidable.
Naturalistic and moralistic fallacies are at the root of the fear of imperfectability and the ensuing embrace of the Blank Slate. The naturalistic fallacy is the belief that whatever happens in nature is good (p. 162,  1). This belief was revived during the 1960s and 1970s during the romantic era. The moralistic fallacy proposes “if a trait is moral, then it must be found in nature.” Therefore, nature [human nature] is predetermined to have only virtuous traits or no traits at all. It would be hard to accept another explanation about human nature. Both advocates of the naturalistic and moralistic fallacies believed that if we were to approve the “biologicization of rape” among animals it would condone rape amongst “our own kind” (p.162,  3). Again we see how society wants to deny any faulty threads in human nature in fear of being known as tolerant of undignified behavior. But if we do not recognize our faults and continuously disavow the many misconceptions about human nature and what is said to be “natural”, how can we begin to “rise above” nature (p. 163, 3)?
In order for us to “rise above” nature, we must first acknowledge the many fallacies about it. If we acknowledge fallacies, such as the naturalistic fallacy, we do not do away with the facts about nature nor does it make the facts irrelevant. By recognizing the fallacies, we find that alone they do not dictate nature. The facts must be compared with other moralistic values in order to come to a solution about what is to be done to improve nature (p. 164, 1).
To give a better understanding on “rising above” nature let’s examine step parenting.  Philosophers Martin Daly and Margo Wilson documented an examination of imperfect emotions concerning stepparents. They discovered a trend amongst biological parents and stepparents in raising children. It was proven that in any species, the biological parent of a child was more prone to nurture and protect their offspring with the same genes. Stepparents were found to be more apt to abuse their stepchildren because they were not originated in the initial family circle. To say that all stepparents are abusive would be wrong. We would be eliminating stepparents who really care for their stepchildren and don’t abuse them. It is true that families consisting of stepchildren appear to be unhappy and unstable; but to deny the goodness and benevolence of some stepparents would rob society of a solution that could help improve families overall. Understanding these differences could help enhance marriages as well as enhance the understanding of the instinctive love of biological parents verses the “deliberate kindness” stepparents extend to their stepchildren. The results would lessen resentment and misunderstanding of the stepparent’s behavior, ultimately forming stronger familial ties (p.165).
Acknowledging human nature not only helps “rise above” nature, but it also helps explain noticeable moral progress humanity has made over time (p. 165, 3). Over the years we have done away with slavery, legal ownership of women, and execution by torture by first acknowledging our faults, then finding ways to perfect our behavior. We must continue to “expand our circle” of targets of sympathy and embrace the “entities considered worthy of moral consideration” to continue rising above nature and to diminish the denial of human nature (p. 167, 1). 
However, the question is not if we can change human behavior, but at what cost? The freedom of expression will be tainted and people will suffer. In order to get something, you must be willing to give up something. If we were to do away with stop signs, we wouldn’t have to make frequent stops while driving. However, the rate of car accidents and fatal deaths would increase. The same is with human nature. Yes, wrong behavior would be punished, but other’s happiness and liberty would be violated. We should attempt to lessen belligerent behavior in society, but this can not be achieved through denying society’s imperfect ways. We must examine both the good and bad traits of humanity to improve human nature.

Selfishness is explicitly denied as a part of one’s human nature. To be selfish is to do away with others’ interest and opinions and to fully engulf into one’s self interest. The political implications of selfishness are applied to two major philosophies of how societies should be organized: capitalism and communism. Adam Smith, the advocate for capitalism, suggests that people will selfishly work and be paid according to their abilities as long as the labor suffices according to their needs. Karl Marx, the originator of communism and socialism, insinuates that people work because of compassion or self-actualization (p. 161, 2). Pinker reveals that followers of Marx are baffled at the suggestion that communistic behavior actually runs against our selfish nature. Very few accept the assumption that selfishness is a part of human nature. To accept selfishness as natural behavior is to imply that selfish acts such as hunting endangered species, polluting rivers, and over fishing a harbor are unavoidable.
Naturalistic and moralistic fallacies are at the root of the fear of imperfectability and the ensuing embrace of the Blank Slate. The naturalistic fallacy is the belief that whatever happens in nature is good (p. 162,  1). This belief was revived during the 1960s and 1970s during the romantic era. The moralistic fallacy proposes “if a trait is moral, then it must be found in nature.” Therefore, nature [human nature] is predetermined to have only virtuous traits or no traits at all. It would be hard to accept another explanation about human nature. Both advocates of the naturalistic and moralistic fallacies believed that if we were to approve the “biologicization of rape” among animals it would condone rape amongst “our own kind” (p.162,  3). Again we see how society wants to deny any faulty threads in human nature in fear of being known as tolerant of undignified behavior. But if we do not recognize our faults and continuously disavow the many misconceptions about human nature and what is said to be “natural”, how can we begin to “rise above” nature (p. 163, 3)?
In order for us to “rise above” nature, we must first acknowledge the many fallacies about it. If we acknowledge fallacies, such as the naturalistic fallacy, we do not do away with the facts about nature nor does it make the facts irrelevant. By recognizing the fallacies, we find that alone they do not dictate nature. The facts must be compared with other moralistic values in order to come to a solution about what is to be done to improve nature (p. 164, 1).
To give a better understanding on “rising above” nature let’s examine step parenting.  Philosophers Martin Daly and Margo Wilson documented an examination of imperfect emotions concerning stepparents. They discovered a trend amongst biological parents and stepparents in raising children. It was proven that in any species, the biological parent of a child was more prone to nurture and protect their offspring with the same genes. Stepparents were found to be more apt to abuse their stepchildren because they were not originated in the initial family circle. To say that all stepparents are abusive would be wrong. We would be eliminating stepparents who really care for their stepchildren and don’t abuse them. It is true that families consisting of stepchildren appear to be unhappy and unstable; but to deny the goodness and benevolence of some stepparents would rob society of a solution that could help improve families overall. Understanding these differences could help enhance marriages as well as enhance the understanding of the instinctive love of biological parents verses the “deliberate kindness” stepparents extend to their stepchildren. The results would lessen resentment and misunderstanding of the stepparent’s behavior, ultimately forming stronger familial ties (p.165).
Acknowledging human nature not only helps “rise above” nature, but it also helps explain noticeable moral progress humanity has made over time (p. 165, 3). Over the years we have done away with slavery, legal ownership of women, and execution by torture by first acknowledging our faults, then finding ways to perfect our behavior. We must continue to “expand our circle” of targets of sympathy and embrace the “entities considered worthy of moral consideration” to continue rising above nature and to diminish the denial of human nature (p. 167, 1). <br>
However, the question is not if we can change human behavior, but at what cost? The freedom of expression will be tainted and people will suffer. In order to get something, you must be willing to give up something. If we were to do away with stop signs, we wouldn’t have to make frequent stops while driving. However, the rate of car accidents and fatal deaths would increase. The same is with human nature. Yes, wrong behavior would be punished, but other’s happiness and liberty would be violated. We should attempt to lessen belligerent behavior in society, but this can not be achieved through denying society’s imperfect ways. We must examine both the good and bad traits of humanity to improve human nature.

Daily we are surrounded with the fear of imperfectability. We do not want anyone to find fault in us, especially the citizens of America. We are so focused on the initial, facade appearance of our culture that we do not deal with the underlying factors that slowly drain us of our humanity. Various romantic poets and philosophers, such as William Wordsworth and John Passmore, have hope for some type of reform to improve human nature, but have concluded that such an attempt would be unrealistic. The attempt would only be “saddled with our flaws and deadly sins.” This fear of a permanently immoral human nature takes two forms: practical fear and what is natural is good, also called the naturalistic fallacy (p. 159, 2). Practical fear implies that human nature is unchangeable; therefore, social reformation is unnecessary. Rather, why try to change human nature if it’s not repairable?

Both advocates of the naturalistic and moralistic fallacies believed that if we were to approve the “biologicization of rape” among animals it would condone rape amongst “our own kind” (p.162,  3). Again we see how society wants to deny any faulty threads in human nature in fear of being known as tolerant of undignified behavior. But if we do not recognize our faults and continuously disavow the many misconceptions about human nature and what is said to be “natural”, how can we begin to “rise above” nature (p. 163, 3)?

In order for us to “rise above” nature, we must first acknowledge the many fallacies about it. If we acknowledge fallacies, such as the naturalistic fallacy, we do not do away with the facts about nature nor does it make the facts irrelevant. By recognizing the fallacies, we find that alone they do not dictate nature. The facts must be compared with other moralistic values in order to come to a solution about what is to be done to improve nature (p. 164, 1).

To give a better understanding on “rising above” nature let’s examine step parenting.  Philosophers Martin Daly and Margo Wilson documented an examination of imperfect emotions concerning stepparents. They discovered a trend amongst biological parents and stepparents in raising children. It was proven that in any species, the biological parent of a child was more prone to nurture and protect their offspring with the same genes. Stepparents were found to be more apt to abuse their stepchildren because they were not originated in the initial family circle. To say that all stepparents are abusive would be wrong. We would be eliminating stepparents who really care for their stepchildren and don’t abuse them. It is true that families consisting of stepchildren appear to be unhappy and unstable; but to deny the goodness and benevolence of some stepparents would rob society of a solution that could help improve families overall. Understanding these differences could help enhance marriages as well as enhance the understanding of the instinctive love of biological parents verses the “deliberate kindness” stepparents extend to their stepchildren. The results would lessen resentment and misunderstanding of the stepparent’s behavior, ultimately forming stronger familial ties (p.165).

Acknowledging human nature not only helps “rise above” nature, but it also helps explain noticeable moral progress humanity has made over time (p. 165, 3). Over the years we have done away with slavery, legal ownership of women, and execution by torture by first acknowledging our faults, then finding ways to perfect our behavior. We must continue to “expand our circle” of targets of sympathy and embrace the “entities considered worthy of moral consideration” to continue rising above nature and to diminish the denial of human nature (p. 167, 1). 

However, the question is not if we can change human behavior, but at what cost? The freedom of expression will be tainted and people will suffer. In order to get something, you must be willing to give up something. If we were to do away with stop signs, we wouldn’t have to make frequent stops while driving. However, the rate of car accidents and fatal deaths would increase. The same is with human nature. Yes, wrong behavior would be punished, but other’s happiness and liberty would be violated. We should attempt to lessen belligerent behavior in society, but this can not be achieved through denying society’s imperfect ways. We must examine both the good and bad traits of humanity to improve human nature.

Daily we are surrounded with the fear of imperfectability. We do not want anyone to find fault in us, especially the citizens of America. We are so focused on the initial, facade appearance of our culture that we do not deal with the underlying factors that slowly drain us of our humanity. Various romantic poets and philosophers, such as William Wordsworth and John Passmore, have hope for some type of reform to improve human nature, but have concluded that such an attempt would be unrealistic. The attempt would only be “saddled with our flaws and deadly sins.” This fear of a permanently immoral human nature takes two forms: practical fear and what is natural is good, also called the naturalistic fallacy (p. 159, para. 2). Practical fear implies that human nature is unchangeable; therefore, social reformation is unnecessary. Rather, why try to change human nature if it’s not repairable? Additionally, assuming that if something is natural is good gives leeway to those who commit horrible crimes or abuses their love ones. It excuses their behavior and implies that it is okay.      

Selfishness is explicitly denied as a part of one’s human nature. To be selfish is to do away with others’ interest and opinions and to fully engulf into one’s self interest. The political implications of selfishness are applied to two major philosophies of how societies should be organized: capitalism and communism. Adam Smith, the advocate for capitalism, suggests that people will selfishly work and be paid according to their abilities as long as the labor suffices according to their needs. Karl Marx, the originator of communism and socialism, insinuates that people work because of compassion or self-actualization (p. 161, para 2). Pinker reveals that followers of Marx are baffled at the suggestion that communistic behavior actually runs against our selfish nature. Very few accept the assumption that selfishness is a part of human nature. To accept selfishness as natural behavior is to imply that selfish acts such as hunting endangered species, polluting rivers, and over fishing a harbor are unavoidable.

Naturalistic and moralistic fallacies are at the root of the fear of imperfectability and the ensuing embrace of the Blank Slate. The naturalistic fallacy is the belief that whatever happens in nature is good (p. 162, para  1). This belief was revived during the 1960s and 1970s during the romantic era.

The naturalistic fallacy is the belief that whatever happens in nature is good (p. 162, para  1). This belief was revived during the 1960s and 1970s during the romantic era. The moralistic fallacy proposes “if a trait is moral, then it must be found in nature.” Therefore, nature [human nature] is predetermined to have only virtuous traits or no traits at all. It would be hard to accept another explanation about human nature. Both advocates of the naturalistic and moralistic fallacies believed that if we were to approve the “biologicization of rape” among animals it would condone rape amongst “our own kind” (p.162, para.  3). Again we see how society wants to deny any faulty threads in human nature in fear of being known as tolerant of undignified behavior. But if we do not recognize our faults and continuously disavow the many misconceptions about human nature and what is said to be “natural”, how can we begin to “rise above” nature (p. 163, para. 3)?

In order for us to “rise above” nature, we must first acknowledge the many fallacies about it. If we acknowledge fallacies, such as the naturalistic fallacy, we do not do away with the facts about nature nor does it make the facts irrelevant. By recognizing the fallacies, we find that alone they do not dictate nature. The facts must be compared with other moralistic values in order to come to a solution about what is to be done to improve nature (p. 164, para. 1).

To give a better understanding on “rising above” nature let’s examine step parenting.  Philosophers Martin Daly and Margo Wilson documented an examination of imperfect emotions concerning stepparents. They discovered a trend amongst biological parents and stepparents in raising children. It was proven that in any species, the biological parent of a child was more prone to nurture and protect their offspring with the same genes. Stepparents were found to be more apt to abuse their stepchildren because they were not originated in the initial family circle. To say that all stepparents are abusive would be wrong. We would be eliminating stepparents who really care for their stepchildren and don’t abuse them. It is true that families consisting of stepchildren appear to be unhappy and unstable; but to deny the goodness and benevolence of some stepparents would rob society of a solution that could help improve families overall. Understanding these differences could help enhance marriages as well as enhance the understanding of the instinctive love of biological parents verses the “deliberate kindness” stepparents extend to their stepchildren. The results would lessen resentment and misunderstanding of the stepparent’s behavior, ultimately forming stronger familial ties (p.165).

Acknowledging human nature not only helps “rise above” nature, but it also helps explain noticeable moral progress humanity has made over time (p. 165, para. 3). Over the years we have done away with slavery, legal ownership of women, and execution by torture by first acknowledging our faults, then finding ways to perfect our behavior. We must continue to “expand our circle” of targets of sympathy and embrace the “entities considered worthy of moral consideration” to continue rising above nature and to diminish the denial of human nature (p. 167, para. 1). 

However, the question is not if we can change human behavior, but at what cost? The freedom of expression will be tainted and people will suffer. In order to get something, you must be willing to give up something. If we were to do away with stop signs, we wouldn’t have to make frequent stops while driving. However, the rate of car accidents and fatal deaths would increase. The same is with human nature. Yes, wrong behavior would be punished, but other’s happiness and liberty would be violated. We should attempt to lessen belligerent behavior in society, but this can not be achieved through denying society’s imperfect ways. We must examine both the good and bad traits of humanity to improve human nature.

Daily we are surrounded with the fear of imperfectability. We do not want anyone to find fault in us, especially the citizens of America. We are so focused on the initial, facade appearance of our culture that we do not deal with the underlying factors that slowly drain us of our humanity. Various romantic poets and philosophers, such as William Wordsworth and John Passmore, have hope for some type of reform to improve human nature, but have concluded that such an attempt would be unrealistic. The attempt would only be “saddled with our flaws and deadly sins.” This fear of a permanently immoral human nature takes two forms: practical fear and what is natural is good, also called the naturalistic fallacy (p. 159, para. 2). Practical fear implies that human nature is unchangeable; therefore, social reformation is unnecessary. Rather, why try to change human nature if it’s not repairable? Additionally, assuming that if something is natural is good gives leeway to those who commit horrible crimes or abuses their love ones. It excuses their behavior and implies that it is okay.      

Selfishness is explicitly denied as a part of one’s human nature. To be selfish is to do away with others’ interest and opinions and to fully engulf into one’s self interest. The political implications of selfishness are applied to two major philosophies of how societies should be organized: capitalism and communism. Adam Smith, the advocate for capitalism, suggests that people will selfishly work and be paid according to their abilities as long as the labor suffices according to their needs. Karl Marx, the originator of communism and socialism, insinuates that people work because of compassion or self-actualization (p. 161, para 2). Pinker reveals that followers of Marx are baffled at the suggestion that communistic behavior actually runs against our selfish nature. Very few accept the assumption that selfishness is a part of human nature. To accept selfishness as natural behavior is to imply that selfish acts such as hunting endangered species, polluting rivers, and over fishing a harbor are unavoidable.
