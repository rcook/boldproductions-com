Steven Pinker was born on September 18, 1954 in an English-speaking Jewish community in Montreal, Cananda (Harvard University Department of Psychology, n.d.). Pinker converted to atheism at the age of 13 and quickly became interested in studying the human mind (Linder, 2004). In 1976, he graduated from McGill University in Montreal with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology (Harvard University Department of Psychology, 2003). After finishing at McGill, he moved on to Harvard, where he pursued his doctorate in Experimental Psychology (Harvard University Department of Psychology, n.d.). He also received a post-doctorate fellowship from MIT and spent the next few years teaching at both Harvard and MIT. Pinker has also been the recipient of numerous academic honors and awards for his research and publications.<br><br>
