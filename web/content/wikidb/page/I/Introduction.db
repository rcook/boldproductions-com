Poverty and welfare are two of the most important and pertinent policy issues today. Despite the well-known view that America is the world's "richest" country, the problem of poverty is persistent in this country. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 11% of Americans live below the poverty line (Eitzen & Smith, 2003). The poverty line is a poor indicator, however, as many people who live above it do not have a standard of living where their basic needs are met. Approximately 3.1 million families in the United States live in poverty, with 1.5 million of those families living below 50% of the poverty line (Jones-DeWeever et al., 2003; as cited in Riger & Staggs, 2004). The United States has the highest rate of child poverty among industrialized nations; one in every six children in the United States lives in poverty (Eitzen & Smith, 2003). The United States also has one of the highest infant mortality rates among democratic and developed countries (Moravcsik, 2005). In addition, 15.5% of all American children do not have health insurance and half of a million children are homeless (Eitzen & Smith, 2003). 

Federally-funded welfare for individuals and families living in poverty began during the Great Depression. The federal government created the minimum wage, food stamps, subsidized housing, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and other programs under the administration of presidents such as Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson (Eitzen & Smith, 2003). While these programs were not sufficient to eliminate poverty, they were able to help many people escape its clutches. 

The 1990s marked a change in the paradigm of welfare and policies dealing with poverty. In 1996, Congress passed a bill known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). Perhaps the most significant change the bill brought about was a reduction of federal funding of welfare programs by 55 billion dollars over a period of six years (Eitzen & Smith, 2003). Further changes to welfare, such as time limits, work requirements, and other requirements, were tacked on to the PRWORA.
