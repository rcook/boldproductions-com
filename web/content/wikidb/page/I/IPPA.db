Althrough some searh engines identify the Society as the International Pelvic Pain Association officially it is the International Pevlic Pain Society (IPPS). The IPPS was founded in 1996 by a group of gynecologists, urologists, psychologists, and other health professionals committed to an interdiscliplinary approach to the treatment of chronic pelvic pain. The Society's vision is to improve the quality of life for the millions of women around the world suffering from chronic pelvic pain.

There is about 3 billion females in the world and approximately 200 million suffer from chronic pelvic pain. Out of the 200 million women with chronic pelvic pain, 61% (140 million) of these women go undiagnosed (The International Pelvic Pain Society, n.d.). The statistics are staggering, but what are most unfortunate are the horrible effects of this condition on the quality of life for women: inability to exercise, perform chores, and work; difficullty sleeping, walking, and concentrating; interference with socializing and sexuality; lack of leisure enjoyment; and suicidal ideation (International Pelvic Pain Society, n. d.).
Patients with chronic pelvic pain have been in pain for six months or more and conventional treatment has not alleviated their suffering. They appear depressed
with increasinly limited physical activity. Reported pain is more significant than diagnosed degree of tissue damage. Due to significant pain their family role has changed. 

The International Pelvic Pain Society's two primary objectives are to educate health care professionals on how to diagnosis and manage chronic pelvic pain, thereby changing the lives of patients worldwide and to bring hope to women who suffer from chronic pelvic pain by significantly raising public awareness and impacting individual lives. Long range goals include to serve as an educational resource for health care professionals, to optimize diagnosis and treatment of patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain, to collate research in chronic pelvic pain, and to inform women to serve as a resource of education for treatment options and professional health care members. The short range goal is to recruit, organize, and educate health care professionals actively involved with the treatment of patients who have chronic pelvic pain.

The Society has a two step plan. The first step lasted from 1996-2002. During this time they held eight international scientific meetings; developed strategic partnerships with other organizations such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the World Congress of Endometriosis; and developed and implemented tools that advance the organizational objectives of physician education and public awareness. Step 2 will last from 2002-2007. During this time the IPPS plans on establishing a world headquarters; establishing five, two-year Chronic Pelvic Pain and Advanced Endoscopy Training Fellowships, developing an International/Multilingual interactive educational website, and ongoing publishing of textbooks, training materials, and educational tools.
