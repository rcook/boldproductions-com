[[Chenoweth]] and [[Benoweth]] and [[Anasuri]] refer to pages defined, waiting to be described. Click on a question mark and the new page will appear. Type anything you like on it and then click on Save. The page will automatically be created on the server and will have a permanent link from this Sandbox page.[[ParentingWebsites]]

This is how I defined the page: I typed double-brackets (click on the Edit link at the bottom of the page to see) and the name of the new page inside them. The wiki inserted the question mark automatically.

OK, [[Kerry]], it's your turn.

Create new page[[new]]

I (Kerry Lopez) took the prompt above and entered a page about Dyslexia.  [[Anyone]] want to take a look and add a page of their own?

I (Delores Hunter) like to participate in experiments. Kerry I agree with you that testing should be addressed in public schools.
I would like feedback on a video presentation for seniors who dont have any experience with computers. (target age 55+)?   

I am experimenting in the sandbox; you see I am quite the gestalt and like to experiment.  I am all for playing too! (LaDonna) Anyone care to play along?
