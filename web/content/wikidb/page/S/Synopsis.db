<i>“Everyone has a theory of human nature.” – Steven Pinker</center></i><br><br>[[Pinker]]

Steven Pinker’s book The Blank Slate is a testament to how important it is to adopt a correct understanding of human nature. According to Pinker, our view of human nature dictates how we perceive humans themselves, culture, social institutions, and social problems. Theories of human nature are often based on current philosophical, cultural, political, or religious thought, often without knowing or accepting all of the facts. Because of the importance of understanding human nature in its truest form, Pinker discusses three common theories of human nature in American culture and then discusses his own theory of human nature. <br><br> I don't like this...we should change

American culture today is thick with the theory of the Blank Slate. The Blank Slate theory says that the human mind begins with no innate structure.  Each human is born as a blank slate (tabula rasa) on which society can inscribe who that person becomes. This theory is also known as empiricism, first proposed by John Locke, as a way of attacking the political status quo of his time, where kings ruled by “divine right.” His belief was that everyone started off as equals at birth and could then become anything society or they themselves prescribed. <br><br>

The second theory of human nature that Pinker discusses is the theory of the Noble Savage, also known as Romanticism.  This theory came about because of European colonizer’s views that humans in their most natural state are peaceful and unselfish. In this view, what causes humans to become evil and to adopt selfish behaviors is civilization. Technology and scientific advances are often seen as perpertrators of many social problems. <br><br>

The third theory Pinker condemns is the theory of the Ghost in the Machine, also known as dualism. Dualism is the belief that the mind and the body are two separate entities. Dualists believe in the existence of a soul that guides decision-making processes in each human being. This soul is the true essence of human nature, in this view, and is accountable for all human behavior. <br><br>

Pinker explains his theory of human nature, a mind-body holism (belief that the mind and the body are one entity and inextricable from one another) by building four “bridges” between biology and culture. The first bridge is cognitive science, the science of the mind. Cognitive scientists believe that all human processes are innate and can be traced back to the human brain. The second bridge is neuroscience, the study of how the brain produces cognition and emotions. Neuroscience seeks to explain how human emotions are a product of physiological circumstances. The third bridge is behavioral genetics. This is the study of how genes influence behavior. According to Pinker, genes can influence, if not cause, certain behaviors in humans. The fourth bridge is evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychology attempts to understand what human behaviors have led to evolutionary success and how the brains deals with natural selection. <br><br>

So what role does culture play in human behavior? According to Pinker, culture is 

<blockquote>“a pool of technological and social innovations that people accumulate to help them live their lives, not a collection of arbitrary roles and symbols that happen to befall them” (p. 65).</blockquote><br>
 
<center><b>What’s so bad about the Blank Slate anyway?</center></b><br><br>

Why do we fear losing the Blank Slate to biological and evolutionary explanations of human behavior? Pinker says that we have tagged onto biology many irrational fears that we believe the Blank Slate theory alleviates. For example, we believe that biological explanations of human nature can give way to justification of prejudices and discrimination because differences in people are innate rather than socially constructed.  The Blank Slate, we believe, protects us from discrimination by assuming that all people start off equally and inequalities are socially prescribed.  Pinker says that the Blank Slate is not necessary to protect us from inequality; humans are also endowed with a moral sense that says that judging individuals based on innate qualities is wrong.  Equality is a moral universal which every human being understands and desires. Societies that are enlightened understand and acknowledge human differences and create strength in those differences.<br><br>

Humans also fear losing the Blank Slate because they fear imperfectability.  If behavior in humans is innate, we worry that human nature is unchangeable and unfixable.  According to Pinker, understanding human nature can only help efforts toward social change.  Denying innate human behaviors is akin to turning a blind eye to the real problems underlying social problems.  <br><br>

Another fear we have is the fear of determinism.  We equate genetic predisposition to genetic determinism which according to Pinker is a fallacy.  Despite the fact that human behaviors have genetic ties, human beings can still be held responsible for their behaviors. Social institutions and systems provide rules of behavior that can help deter humans from falling “victim” to their innate desires.<br><br>

Finally, Pinker notes that we hold tightly to the Blank Slate because we fear Nihilism.  We fear that biological explanations of human nature erase purpose from our lives.  Biology, however, does not devalue human life; rather it acknowledges the beauty and complexity of human beings.  <br><br>

The Blank Slate is not the answer to all our fears.  Instead, Pinker says that,<br><blockquote>
“[It] is an anti-life, anti-human, theoretical abstraction that denies our common humanity, our inherent interests, and our individual preferences.  Though it has pretensions of celebrating our potential, it does the opposite, because our potential comes from the combinatorial interplay of wonderfully complex faculties, not from the passive blankness of an empty tablet.”  (pg. 421) </blockquote><br>

Truly understanding human nature awakens us to our strengths and our shortcomings and invites us to become better human beings, understanding and accepting our innate differences and building a society that flourishes in those differences.  <br><br>
