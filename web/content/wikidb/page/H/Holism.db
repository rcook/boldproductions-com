Psychologist Steven Pinker lays out a very lucid argument about the reality of human nature in his book <i>The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature</i> (2002).  The early chapters in the book are devoted to discussion of three commonly accepted doctrines of human nature which include the theories of the Blank Slate, the Noble Savage and the Ghost in the Machine.  In the first of the three theories, the Blank Slate, humans are thought to be born literally with no innate traits or tendencies.  We are seen as malleable, much like clay to be sculpted by what we learn in our environments.  The Noble Savage view is that humans are born innately good with peaceful, altruistic tendencies and are only corrupted through civilization.  The third theory of the Ghost in the Machine contends there is a dualism to human existence wherein the “soul” or conscience is separate from the biological substance of our bodies.  This belief likens human sentience to an immaterial spirit that operates independent of the mortality of the organism it inhabits. 

As an evolutionary psychologist, Pinker asserts none of the theories adequately explain human nature or how it affects our interaction in the tangible world as none of them recognize the reality of our organic operation.  Instead, Pinker draws from the theories of Darwin and other great thinkers to show human nature as rooted in our biological wiring.  All thought and behavior is derived (influenced by) from our innate chemistry.  Pinker contends that all individuals are members of the greater whole known as Homo Sapiens, making us universally think and behave in very similar ways no matter our history, culture or environment.  Our senses are hard-wired into our make-up and our experience of existence consists in the complex biological functions that drive our beliefs and actions.  Because we are compelled by our human nature (our biology), our single most constant goal is to perpetuate our own survival and in turn contribute to the continuance of Homo Sapiens. 

Strikingly, Pinker’s view of human nature adheres to the holistic perspective first introduced in 1926 by South African scholar Jan Christian Smuts.  Smuts’ theory of Holism asserts:

	Both matter and life consist, in the atom and the cell, of unit structures whose
	ordered grouping produces the natural wholes which we call bodies or 
	organisms.  This character or feature of “wholeness”....points to something
	fundamental in the universe, fundamental in the sense that it is practically
	universal, that it is a real operative factor, and that its shaping influence is felt
	ever more deeply and widely with the advance of Evolution.  Holism is the
	term here coined (from the Greek <i>holos</i> – whole) to designate this fundamental
	factor operative towards the making or creation of wholes in the universe
	(pp. 87-98).
  
Smuts says here what Pinker seems to reiterate: that the wholeness of human existence is created by the unity of biological functions and that as we are these wholes, the creating of wholes is our fundamental purpose.  And, the process of evolution further serves us to meet our objective as we are fine-tuned to be a step more efficient at our end with every evolutionary cycle.  Indeed, Pinker acknowledges the influences of culture, social interaction, values, education and learning in the evolving human nature but asserts that we are hard-wired not only to facilitate each of these influences but also to take advantage of them in sharpening our fitness for survival in the evolutionary process.  These ideas were first promoted in Smuts’ Holism too.  Smuts said our personalities are supreme wholes that have arisen out of our holistic evolution.   According to Smuts (1926):

	What we inherit is....a wide possibility and potency of moulding
	ourselves….the capacity of free and self-determined action and development 
	in our individual lives (p. 274).  Personality takes in and assimilates all the 
 social and other influences which surround it, and makes them all contribute
 towards its holistic self-realization (p. 291).

Pinker (2002) grudgingly acknowledges the holistic nature of his assertions along these lines when considering how human nature (biological functioning) can create subjective feelings and enable us to freely make choices in our lives:

	These puzzles have an infuriatingly holistic quality to them.  Consciousness
	and free will seem to suffuse the neurobiological phenomena at every level,
	and cannot be pinpointed to any combination of interaction among parts.  The
	best analyses from our combinatorial intellects provide no hooks on which
	we can hang these strange entities, and thinkers seem condemned either to
	denying their existence or to wallowing in mysticism (p. 240). 

Holistic theories generally recognize that wholes are greater than the sum of their parts but also posit that parts are related in such a way that their functioning is conditioned by their relationship to each other (Wilber, n.d.).  This gives rise to the notion that humans, as parts of the Homo Sapiens species, do in fact shape each other through interaction.  Individuals as well as groups of individuals <i>choose</i> values that intervene in behavior.  We make varying choices because we are inherently different in our genes and our personal histories.  But, according to holistic view, these variations are also part of the unity of human nature.  We are unified in that our genetic traits hard-wire us to think and choose behavior.  Holism does not, however, proscribe that genes <i>cause</i> all behavior, only that they <i>influence</i> our choices of behavior.  Pinker’s view follows this thinking in many areas of his book.

On page 119, Pinker describes the black-and-white thinking of the defenders of the Blank Slate theory.  His basic argument is that it is only the all or none perspective of the Blank Slate belief that leads to the mistaken assertion that <i>all</i> aspects of behavior are innate rather than his view that <i>some</i> aspects of behavior are innate and similarly, the erroneous assertion that genetic traits <i>determine</i> human actions rather than only <i>influence</i> them.  In a discussion of moral dilemmas in another part of his book, Pinker contends there are no real solutions to human moral choices because of the “incommensurability” between our hard-wired intuitions and our actual physical biology.  What our genetics guide us to then, is not an ability to <i>find</i> moral truths but to <i>choose</i> them.  It is through these choices that we serve to shape our own evolution.  Here, we come back to Holism.

Humans, as biological wholes, are operators in the systemic whole of human nature.  Smuts explained this stating that the term Holism denotes the totality of wholes which operate as real factors and give to reality its dynamic evolutionary creative character (Ansbacher, 1961).  Smuts’ (1926) perspective is particularly relevant to Pinker’s ideas in the following passage:

	Mind has its conscious illuminated area and its subconscious “field”.... it
	is of an intensely holistic unanalyzable character....Through its dual activity of
	conception and conation, mind forms “purposes” which invisage future
	experience and make the future an operative factor in the present.  Purpose
	marks the liberation of mind from the domination of circumstances and indicates
	its free creative activity (p. 226).

In other words, humans are participants in their own evolving nature but are so because of the very nature in which they are endowed.  Reality then in the holist view, is this process of evolutionary change driven by the dynamic interaction between the parts (humans) and the whole (human nature) (Wilber, n.d.).

A critical element of holistic theory is the belief that human systems tend to develop a characteristic wholeness or integrity (Wilber, n.d.) which compels an interest in social or community well-being.  Pinker’s view varies only slightly from this thinking.  He sees humans as “very well-equipped for the demands of reciprocal atltruism” (p. 255), which he attributes to an inherent self-serving interest in gaining the obvious benefits of cooperation.  Pinker seems to believe that reciprocity allows us to contribute to the common good of our system while gaining a leg up on the evolutionary competition for ourselves. The difference in Pinker’s view and the view of traditional holists on this subject lies in the area of goals.  Alfred Adler, a subscriber to holistic theories, believed that human goal-directed behavior is a product of the human need to belong (a goal of being) (Driekurs-Ferguson, 2001).  In contrast, evolutionary psychology and Pinker emphasize competition for resources as the motivation for cooperative behavior (a goal of possession).

The fact that Pinker and holistic theorists differ in their views about the source of community ethics is not to say Pinker’s perspective is not compatible with Holism.  Wilber (n.d.) asserts that holists often disagree on the sources of the unifying factors in human nature. The over-arching theory that the characteristics of a part (human) are largely determined by the whole (human nature) to which it belongs is really the key.  Pinker’s adherence to this perspective throughout his book is what aligns his arguments with Holism.

Because of Pinker’s adherence to a general holistic view, his theory can be related to contemporary family theories, particularly Family Systems Theory and Human Ecological Theory.  In Family Systems Theory like Holism, the whole is also considered greater than the sum of its parts.  Individuals within families are seen as products of the whole family system to which they belong.  Motivations and behavior are shaped by the familial whole and the dynamic interaction between family members (parts) is instrumental in creating the family efficacy.  Human Ecological Theory is likewise linked to Pinker’s views in that this theory sees families as systems (parts) within many systems forming the greater whole of humanity.  Each system influences and is influenced by the systemic movement of the other systems (Walcheski & Bredehoft, 2003).  As has been established, Pinker recognizes the various systems of society that play a role in the evolutionary process of humans.  Systems such as religion, education and politics are all part of the web of human nature which we are biologically set to weave in an effort to evolve ourselves to the next stage of reality.

The latter point may shed light on the crux of Pinker’s theory and the holistic approach it carries.  In viewing humans as integral parts of the whole that is their being and recognizing they are active participants in the systemic movements they choose, it becomes clear that a convergence of consciousness will eventually be necessary in order for humans to effectively develop an evolutionary plan.  Pinker’s position in dispelling the theories of the Blank Slate, the Noble Savage and the Ghost in the Machine seems to align with beliefs discussed in Broadbent’s (2002) article <i>Design and Sociocultural Evolution: Theoretical and Practical Considerations</i>.   Broadbent cited many scholars contending that developing an evolutionary consciousness in humans would permit them to create a vision for guiding their futures to the most efficient end.  While this has somewhat sinister sounding tones, what is being promoted really is the notion that we are stifled by the established frameworks of human nature (Broadbent).  If we are to truly “rise above our nature” and realize our aspirations of evolutionary transcendence, we should be able to clear away barriers and obstacles to the process (like fallible ideologies of the soul) and creatively embrace the resources best equipped to carry us forth (i.e. technology, stem cell research, etc.).
