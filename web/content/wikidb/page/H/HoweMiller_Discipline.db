This question is always a tough one for me.  In my experience with my own children, "discipline" was never an issue.  I guess I'd have to say that discipline involves both parent and child.  There is mutual respect and honoring of each other, and each person knows how they are to interact with each other, based on the climate that the parents set early on (en utero, I suppose).  "Discipline" was effortless with my children.  There was never discussion of "do's" and "don't's."  Now, I don't want you to think that my children had the run of the house and ran over me.  It wasn't like that at all.  We just all interacted in a peaceful, nonviolent, easygoing atmosphere of love.  I know this might sound idealistic, and many parents would argue with my methods, however, I have to tell you it worked for me.  

As I work in the public schools as a substitute teacher, I see the "discipline plan" that is enforced each day with these children.  It doesn't feel like discipline.  It feels like crowd control.  In my opinion, they aren't teaching the children how to make "good" decisions.  They are teaching from fear.  There really shouldn't be a need for a "discipline plan" if parents handled things differently from the get go. 

Now, that's my opinion, and I have many people who would argue with me.  All I have to say is look at our social system, our prison system, our government and see how well this has worked......

How do you define discipline?

My definition of discipline is as follows: the act of teaching and training an individual to act, react, and respond in a manner that is acceptable. Therefore the ultimate goal of discipline teaching and training is to help the individual create self-discipline.

Discipline, I would say, is training that corrects the mind and heart.

I like the idea of discipline as training of acceptable behavior but I believe many people see it as synonymous with controlling behavior.

In our home we viewed discipline as exhorting individuals to wholesome self direction, conscience of others and respecting world surroundings. Delores Hunter

Discipline is teaching and guidance. Children often want someone to set the limits for them and I believe that this can be done without the threat of punishment. You can teach and guide children by giving them choices (may not always be the choice that they want) and they learn that you will always have choices and there may be consequences to those choices. We all learn day by day how to discipline ourselves.

Discipline is about teaching. It is more about guidance than it is about control. When we make discipline about control we miss the benefits of educating our children. -- Mark DeYoung

Discipline is like a rudder of a ship - guiding a child through life and helping them get back on course when they take a wrong turn.  Not only do we teach and guide to get them back on the right course, we are observant along the way to make sure they stay on the right course.  This requires a parent to be alert and attentive to their children.  Parents also need to grow and mature in life in order to give their children the wisdom needed to get back on the right track and for their children to know they are always there if they should steer in the wrong direction.  -- Cindy Stumph
