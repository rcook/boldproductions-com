The Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS) began in 1986.  It is located at the AIDS Research Institute of the University of California in San Francisco.  In 1996 they helped to develop the National Sexual Health Survey (NSHA).  All instruments used are in English and Spanish.<br><br>  

     The CAPS program is dedicated to finding ways of preventing HIV transmission.  The prevention programs include:  developing policies (local, state, federal and national), which help to stop the spread of HIV in the United States and also within developing countries.  AIDS prevention education is stressed in all they do.<br><br>  

     They have a Technology and Information area called (CORE) that is available for all researchers to use to access needed information.  Fact sheets are also available regarding certain populations and specifics.  Fact sheets may cover infomation regarding special target groups such as Minority Communities in the U.S., Gay Immigrants from Mexico, Educating Children about HIV, Black Men who are Gay, Tests and Counseling availability in Developing Countries, Mental Health information for Gay men, Interventions for Medical Workers who treat HIV patients, Preventions for Drug Users and much more.<br><br>

     THE MISSION of CAPS is AIDS PREVENTION.  Theories, policies, research do change as the disease changes.  Prevention methods are offered to communities and there is an INternational Program that bings in 6 scientists from various developing countries each summer to learn new ways to fight the disease and to take back important information to their country.<br><br>  

Some of the preventions that they teach include:  Trial uses of female condoms, teaching preventions to Asian masseuers, outreach programs for testing, project HIP-HOP for those who are in prison or who have been recently released.  Special instruction is also offered regarding Hepatitis C and the spread of HIV through Oral Sex, and information regarding a connection between HIV, Herpes 8, and Cancer.  Side effects of HIV treatments are discussed in their educational services.<br><br>

Some sample questions (there are over 120 questions on the NSHS survey) include:<br><br>

1.  Questioning the clients general health for the past six months.<br><br>

2.  If the client is legally married, divorced or never married.<br><br>

3.  If they live with a spouse.<br><br>

4.  What country they were born in.<br><br>

5.  Racial background.<br><br>

6.  Have they practiced any religion within the past 12 months.<br><br>

7.  Have they ever received a blood transfusion.<br><br>

8.  Have they ever had an AIDS test before.<br><br>

9.  Do they feel that they will get AIDS within the next five years.<br><br>

10.  Have you ever provided healthcare for a patient with AIDS.<br><br>

     CAPS also offers training to new scientists, settles problems regarding ethics in HIV research, preventions, and caring for patients who are HIV potitive.<br><br>
