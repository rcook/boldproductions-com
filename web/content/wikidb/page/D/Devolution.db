Recent welfare policy changes have relied heavily on devolution to local governments. Devolution is a shift of policy-making power to lower levels of government. In the case of welfare devolution, states are given the power to allocate funds to create and implement programs specific to that state. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which passed in 1996, gave state governments primary responsibility for welfare programs (Kelleher & Yackee, 2004). States receive funding in the form of block grants which are then used to fund local TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) programs and policies. In 2004, the Bush administration made further welfare devolutions, transferring programs such as Medicaid, Section 8 Housing, and Head Start to local jurisdictions (Kelleher & Yackee, 2004). 


Devolution was first utilized by Lyndon Johnson in 1967, in what has been termed as the first federalist policy in the 21st century. His program, known as Johnson's Law Assistance Block Grant (1967), as well as Nixon's State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, Community Development Block Grant, and Title XX of the Social Security Act, were the first instances of devolution in modern American government (Videka-Sherman & Viggiani, 1996). Johnson and Nixon believed that   giving local governments more power would allow them to reform federal services to meet the specific needs of local communities. Despite this change in the political paradigm, Nixon and Johnson still believed that public sector programs, such as health care, welfare, and environmental concerns, should be the responsibility of the federal government (Videka-Sherman & Viggiani, 1996). Today, devolution has reached these once public-sector programs and has given most of the responsibility to local governments to meet the needs of their citizens.     

Proponents of devolution suggest that it allows welfare policy decisions to be made by those who are "closer to the people," the local governments (Kelleher & Yackee, 2004, p. 254). This is the crux of devolution, that giving power to lower levels of government will allow people to receive benefits that are more specific to their needs. Research shows that poverty is experienced differently by different groups, depending on their ethnicity, where they live (urban or rural), and the resources available to them. Devolution can allow for innovative policies to be created to meet specific needs of populations. Research also shows that county officials believe that devolution allows them to better solve policy problems in their communities (Kelleher & Yackee, 2004). Also, if family education groups (such as Family Impact Seminars) are available on a statewide basis, there is increased public and government education and communication on policy issues (Mayer & Hutchins, 1998).    


Opponents of devolution claim theories of federalism that state that devolution is driven by legislative politics, rather than by the belief that officials who are "closer to the people" will make better legislative decisions (Gainsborough, 2003). This theory indicates that devolution is about political gain rather than about helping people in poverty. Opponents also point out that the federal government gave states more power to make policy decisions while simultaneously cutting federal support by 20% (Videka-Sherman & Viggiani, 1996). The cut in support hurts the state governments and forces them to either raise taxes or cut programs for the poor (either of which punishes, rather than helps, the poor). Another problem with devolution is that it gives local governments the power to enact time limits, family caps, and work requirements that can decrease benefits to families (Robbins & Barcus, 2004). State governments may feel pressure to limit benefits to the poor, also known as the "race to the bottom," to avoid migration of more poor people to their state (Gainsborough, 2003).


Devolution has become a solution for the federal government's fiscal problems. Instead of assuming responsibility for needy citizens, the federal government can pass the responsibility, along with a small amount of funding, to the subnational governments (Kelleher & Yackee, 2004). Along with this devolution, there is a loss of accountability for how funds are spent as well as the effectiveness of the programs that are created (Vikeka-Sherman & Viggiani, 1996). As more state governments feel the pressure of devolution, they are more likely to devolve policy-making power to local governments (Gainsborough, 2003). Local governments may lack adequate staff or leaders who educated in effective policy strategies. Also, because of the stronger influence of businesses on local governments, the needs of the poor may become subservient to the needs of the business community (Gainsborough, 2003). 

So how has devolution impacted families and programs for families? For one, it has thwarted efforts of family professionals to educate policy-makers regarding policies that affect families. With more policy power going to the states, the need for more information-providing programs, such as the Family Impact Seminars, has increased. These programs, however, are only intact in three states (Mayer & Hutchins, 1998). That means that there are 47 other states where policy-makers may be making decisions on family welfare without having adequate information (Mayer & Hutchins, 1998).

Also, despite indications that welfare caseloads and poverty levels have decreased since the 1990s devolution, research indicates that quality of life for those who have left welfare programs is not good (Robbins & Barcus, 2004). This research also shows that those who live in metro areas have benefited more from welfare programs than those in nonmetro or rural areas (Robbins & Barcus, 2004). This indicates that the specificity that proponents ascribe to state policy-making may not actually occur; the research counters the crux of devolution.
