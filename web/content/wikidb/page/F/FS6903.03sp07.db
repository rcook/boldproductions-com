Explain vocabulary terms from the Blackboard shell, add new terms, and make constructive edits to other people's entries:

1.<font color="a020f0"> Avatar@SL (2nd Life)</font> Second life is a virtual world on the internet. Worlds (not planets) are created and "you" avatar can visit. An avatar would be "you" in the virtual sense. "You" can have any persona you want, hence "Second Life". There are exciting opportunities for educators, such as creating a virtual classroom. For instance, Otis art school in California puts on an art show, where you can view students' art work via Second Life. Another example is <font color="blue"> http://infoisland.org </font>, where librarians can meet for book clubs or have discussions about education in Second Life. By the way, Dr. Chenoweth wants her own island...

<p> 2. ChaCha - Not just a fast latin dance! Chacha is a new search engine found a www.chacha.com.

Personal experience: The guides haven't been faster or more efficient than me. My Google results were better. In fact, three of the four guide searches I experimented with gave wikipeda as my first results. <br> Possiblities for good: sometimes it helps to have another person's brain to think of search strings, especially if you don't frequently Google.  -Catherine Dutton

3. CMS - tent management system (CMS) is a computer software system used to assist its users in the process of content management. A CMS facilitates the organization, control, and publication of a large body of documents and other content, such as images and multimedia resources. A CMS often facilitates the collaborative creation of documents. A web content management system is a content management system with additional features to ease the tasks required to publish web content to Web sites. - Tricia

4.  Flowersforseymour- Who is Seymour?  Seymour Papert was way before his time in terms of what technology can do for education.  Today he is the world’s foremost expert in this area.  He has been essential in introducing laptop computers into public schools, particularly Maine.  He is a cofounder of the Artificial Intelligence Lat at MIT and MIT Media Lab.  On December 5, 2006, Seymour was struck by a motorcycle when crossing a road.  He had brain surgery.  Individuals and groups are encouraged to support Seymour by sending him flowers.  To do this individuals are encouraged to choose 1 drawing or picture of their favorite flower.  Then the picture is to be placed on a Web page, a Flickr page or you can send it directly to the infobourg at info@infobourg.com Participants are allowed an opportunity to add their wishes or thoughts.  The idea is that there will be a page with links to all of the flowers in order to make the largest virtual bunch of flowers in the world for Seymour Papert and his family. http://www.flowersforseymour.com/en/index.php -Keri Harvey

5.	GUI - A GUI (usually pronounced GOO-ee) is a graphical (rather than purely textual) user interface to a computer. As you read this, you are looking at the GUI or graphical user interface of your particular Web browser. The term came into existence because the first interactive user interfaces to computers were not graphical; they were text-and-keyboard oriented and usually consisted of commands you had to remember and computer responses that were infamously brief. - Tricia

6. International Computer Driving Licence (ICDL)- In 1995, the Council of European Professional Informatics Society (CEPIS) created this program to test computer knowledge.  This organization is based in Australia.  There are testing centers all over Europe.  ICDL is not a course.  It is a computer competency program.  There are seven test that must be completed and passed before one can receive their ICDL.  There are courses offered to help someone study for the test or one can study on their own for the competency test. http://www.acs.org.au/icdl/category.asp?category_id=1
Are you licensed to drive your computer? -Keri

7. Malware- short for "malicious software". Any program or file that gathers information about the computer user without permission. Examples include, viruses, trojan horses or worms. -Leslie

8. Mash-ups - A music term used when combining two or more music tracks. The same concept is used when combining or blending different software programs.  Examples of software mash-ups include webcams, weather information, maps or any program application that has and open API and can be accessed/and combinded with another application on a differnet webite.  (http://www.mashups.com/about.htm) - Denise 

9.	McLuhanism- A term for a catchy phrase or slogan coined by Marshall McLuhan, popular writer and intellectual thinker during the digital revolution. For example, he said, "the medium is the message," meaning that the form of media has a greater impact on society than the content. Another McLuhanism is "the global village." - Tricia

10. McLuhanism- is online jargon.  Marshall McLuhan is a popular writer and intellectual thinking.  He has coined many phrases.  Example:  “the medium is the message,” meaning content of the message did not impact society as much as the form it is reported does. -Keri Harvey

11.<font color="a020f0"> Middle School Dance </font> is tech slang for a pause in communication between devices in a peer-to-peer network, where each device waits for the other to communicate first.  Hence “middle school dance” where the boys are on one side and the girls on the other, each waiting for the other to initiate communication.-Alan Wages 

<p> 12. Middletown Island, eg- Middletown Island is a Second Life island for Ball State University. Classes are held virtually, some professors provide "dorms" for students so they can have free accounts to participate. A few web articles about Islands in education: <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/01/07/2003343824"> Cyberclasses in second life </a> and <a href="http://www.secondlife.intellagirl.com/"> Second Life Education Research Blog </a> (do a find search for Middletown dorms). <a href="http://secondlife.com/community/land-islands.php"> A small island at educational pricing costs $980 and then a $150 monthly maintence fee.</a> -Catherine Dutton

13.<font color="brown"><B> Millennials</font></B>  Millennials are the generation that 'grew up digital' with computers, video games, online access, cell phones, etc. a pervasive part of their lives, often from childhood.  In broad terms, the generations are: the World War II generation, the Baby Boomers, Generation X, and then the Millennials.  Here is a link to a Pew Internet Project & American Life report titled "Teens and Technology: Youth are leading the transition to a fully wired and mobile nation" which sheds some light: http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Tech_July2005web.pdf .  In addition, Stephen Abram, the VP for Innovation [isn't that a cool job title?] at SirsiDynix and one of my favorite library/information world future thinkers and speakers has some of his Power Point presentations about Millennials available online, and I will be glad to link to those, if anyone wants.  - Cherri

14. <font color=red><b> MUVE </b></font>- Multi-User Virtual Environment- Often refers to sim enviroments, games or other multi-user programs online. This is the term you'll want if looking for research on Second Life. -Catherine

15.	network neutrality - A term that refers to a network as not favoring one application over another. In other words, ISPs, or networks, provide services in a nondiscriminatory, unrestricted fashion. – Tricia

16.<font color="brown" face="arial" size="2"><b> Over-Mac'd </b></font>- <font face="arial" size="2">This is a personal favorite. A product that is over-Mac'd is so simple to use that the user perceives the product as less valuable (http://www.netlingo.com/lookup.cfm?term=over-Mac'd). When the technology is perceived as simple, users will often view the product as a toy rather than a gadget. Can anyone think of a good example of a product that has been over-Mac'd in our society (besides the Mac, of course)? -- Amy </font><font color="brown" face="arial" size="2"> Okay, my fiance Michael just came up with an over-Mac'd product: Camera phones (Dr. Chenoweth may correct him on the perceived simplicity, though).</font> <br><br> 

17. P-book:  it is a tool for making readable programs by generating LaTeX-ified program listing.  For example, without this program, if an individual prints out their program it is very difficult to read.  pbook helps improve programs by making them read well on paper.  The p-book generates a PDF output for one to print out and change the program if they wish.  The program is aware of heading, top-level comments and code.-Darlene Hunter

18.	PGP -  A commonly used encryption system developed by Philip Zimmermann. It allows users to send e-mail messages to anyone in the world in complete privacy. With PGP, you can send authentication with your messages so that the recipient can verify that the message really came from you. You can also encrypt sensitive files on your computer so that they remain private even if your computer and disks are stolen. - Tricia

19. <font color="blue"><B>"Read / Write Web"</font></b> [Some of these ideas come from <i>Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms</i> by Will Richardson (Corwin, 2006), as well as articles by Richardson and various other articles and blogs I've read.]  The short expanation: Tim Berners-Lee originally envisoned the World Wide Web as a "collaborative medium" (p. 1).  However, as the Web evolved in its early years, it was more a space where persons could post their somewhat static information without much interaction involved on the part of readers.  That has now changed.  With the multitude of social networking websites, publishing tools, etc., Web readers are now writers, as well.  We can not only read what others wrote but easily publish our own writings, too, interacting and collaborating together. - Cherri

20. <font color="00ced1"> Richard Petty Syndrome </font> occurs when a site uses too many sponsor ads or buttons on its page, making it much like a car or jumpsuit of a race car driver (hence Richard Petty). -Alan Wages<br>
<br>

21. SCORM-Shareable Content Object Reference Model- allows web-based learning systems to find, import, share, reuse, and export learning content in a standardized way  http://www.adlnet.gov/scorm/history/2004/index.cfm -Keri 

22. Scholarpedia- a free online encyclopedia similar to that of Wikipedia (both are sourced through MediaWiki), however Scholarpedia is peer-reviewed and the information provided through the wiki is compiled by experts in the field. Modifications can be made by the public, but are subject to curator and site approval. The current Editor-in-Chief is Eugene M. Izhikevich. -Nicole McAninch

23.	streaming media - Also known as "streaming media," it is the transmission of a media clip, over a network, so that it begins playing back as quickly as possible. Streaming is an Internet data transfer technique that allows users to see video and hear audio files without lengthy download times. - Tricia

24. Streaming Media- http://www.streamingmedia.com/  Streaming means instant flowing.  Streaming Media’s goal is to provide digital media technology with global real-time.  Data is streamed by a server application and it is received and displayed in real-time by the viewer’s applications.  Keri Harvey

25. <font color="blue"><b>Tagging technologies:</font></b> I'm going to start this one since I came across a good article on it from Pew today, but feel free to add more if you want.  A quick definition is that tagging is user-created labels for online content.  It's somewhat analagous to librarians using the Dewey Decimal System or Library of Congress Classification to organize books.  However, tagging is done by the users of an online product or service, not just the 'owners.'  The tags users add become a way to organize the digital information for the user and others to access.  For example, if you upload your photos to Flickr, you can tag the photos so that they group together.  You can see tagging used at http://del.icio.us/ (see the note at the top right) and http://technorati.com .  Tags can be used in lots of creative ways.  Here's how a school of library and information studies in New Zealand uses tags to advertise their school: http://www.sim.vuw.ac.nz/degrees/mlis/MLIS-ad.pdf .  You can read the Pew article from Lee Rainie that I mentioned at http://pewresearch.org/pubs/402/tagging-play .  Cherri

26. Tennis Email-an email exchange with little content.  Tennis email usually consist of short, one-sentence (three- or four-word) replies.-Keri 


27. Top-Level Domain:  The Top-Level Domain is the last part of a web address.  For instance, www.twu.edu, the top-level domain would be .edu.  A country code top-level domain is used by a country or dependent territory such as jp for Japan, ca for Canada, us for United States. – Darlene Hunter

28. UCE - Unsolicited Commercial Email - UCE is junk mail that is costly to internet users and internet-based business. This advertising is one of the leading complaints of internet users as the amount of mail received often increases daily. http://www.cauce.org/ - Denise

29. Warwalking/driving: wardriving is the discovering and documenting the locations of wireless access points while driving.  Warwalking is where the individual uses smaller handheld equipment while walking. Darlene Hunter 


<b><font face= "arial" size="2">30. Web 2.0 - </b>Following the hype that the internet had crashed or was becoming obsolete, geeks, techies, and the general public have begun to tout the emergence of the Web 2.0 (O'Reilly, 2005). Web 2.0 refers to the evolution of web-based applications since the internet boom of the late 1990s. Here is how O'Reilly viewed the evolution from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0:

Web 1.0 --> Web 2.0 <br>
DoubleClick --> Google AdSense <br> 
Ofoto --> Flickr <br>
Akamai --> BitTorrent <br>
mp3.com --> Napster <br>
Britannica Online --> Wikipedia <br>
personal websites --> blogging <br>
evite --> upcoming.org and EVDB <br>
domain name speculation --> search engine optimization <br>
page views --> cost per click <br>
screen scraping --> web services <br>
publishing --> participation <br>
content management systems --> wikis <br>
directories (taxonomy) --> tagging ("folksonomy") <br>
stickiness --> syndication <br><br>

Check out O'Reilly's website (http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html) for his Web 2.0 Meme Map. Also, view the Atlantic monthly magazine for a great article about Web 2.0. Suggestion for class discussion: the integration of Web 2.0 in online courses and online programs. --Amy (Oh, I found another lay article about Web 2.0: http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/01/17/global.office.webguide/index.html)</font><br>
<br> Also- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE">a video that demonstrates the concept of Web 2.0</a> The audio is only background music- nice but not necessary to the message. -Catherine

<p> 31. Webtop- is a virtual desktop running on the internet. The interface looks much like Windows, Mac OS or Linux, but functionality is dependent on internet access. Benefits of webtops include the ability to save work on the internet (making files and settings accessible anywhere with internet access) rather than on your hard drive. Two examples of WebTops are <a href="http://eyeos.org/"> EyeOs</a>, a Mac based OS and <a href="http://virtual-os.com/"> Virtual OS</a>, a DOS-like interface. -Catherine </p>

<p> 32. Yetties- jargon for "young, entrepreneurial, tech-based twenty-somethings" or "young, entrepreneurial technocrats." (from:<a href="http://www.netlingo.com/lookup.cfm?term=yetties"> NetLingo.com)</a> -Catherine

33. Zoo- a collection of viruses and worms that exist in virus and anti-virus labs. "Zookeepers" are actively working to tame the "animals" so that they are not bread or spread. -Leslie
