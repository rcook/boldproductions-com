National Survey of Family Growth<br><br>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) oversees the National Center for Health Services (NCHS), the originating agency that designs and administers the National Survey for Family Growth (NSFG) (Hogan, et al, 2000).   There have been 6 cycles of the NSFG, starting in 1973, 1976, 1982, 1988, 1995, and 2002.  Co-sponsors include, but are not limited to, The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention, and the National Institute of Health (Public Health Reports, 2001).<br><br>
  
The survey inquires about many issues relating to sexuality (e.g.family life, marriage, divorce, fertility, contraception practices, cohabitation, abortion, STDs, and family planning) from interviews with women volunteers between 15 and 44 years of age. (Population Research Institute, 2003; Public Health Reports, 2001). However, the women were not completely chosen at random, but “based on an area probability sample drawn from 120 Primary Sampling Units (PSU’s)” (National Center for Health Service [NCHS], 2004).  The intended audience for this type of research is typically obstetricians, gynecologists, physicians, pediatricians, government agencies and private organizations (Public Health Reports, 2001; Grimes, 1998).  The NSFG conclusions are used as a resource when deciding what services are needed when designing programs for families (Public Health Reports, 2001).<br><br>

The 1995 NSFG was the first cycle to use computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) to enter 13,795 participant’s answers into a computer, reducing response error while allowing the interviewer to customize questions in accordance with the participant’s answers (Hogan, et al, 2000).  This advancement, along with a slight monetary incentive seemed to increase the willingness to disclose information pertaining to sensitive issues, such as abortion and forced intercourse (Mosher, 1998).  The 2002 NSFG included 7,500 men between the ages of 15 and 44, seeking their input on such topics as sterilization, sexual activity, cohabitation, and contraception (Public Health Reports, 2001; Groves, et al, 2004).<br><br>  

With each survey design, emphasis is placed on gaining adequate, yet accurate information about sensitive issues.   One example of a design change was the “happiness scale” that originally attempted to capture a woman’s response to an unintended pregnancy by only providing 3 choices, “intended/mistimed/unwanted” (Peterson & Mosher, 1999).  The new NSFG provides a continuous scale, offering a broader, more subjective way to describe a participant’s emotion. NSFG findings have been found in 300 studies in academic journals,and data collection has been used throughout thousands of newspaper and magazine articles (NCHS, 2004).<br><br>
