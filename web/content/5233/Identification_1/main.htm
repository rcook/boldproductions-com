      Channel and channel capacity (both the&nbsp; terms and concepts) emerged

      introduction of kinesics in 1952 spurred the use of film for analysis of

      relatively short career (he died at age 44) produced relative semantics 
      and the notion that one's language is tied to one's culture. Less accepted 
      today is his apparent belief that one's language determines one's 
      thinking. This insurance agent turned academic did not document direct 
      observation or research of the populations he wrote about, leading to 
      serious errors about Hopi Indians (based on his conversation with one Hopi 
      member who lived in New York City). Still, his works (along with teacher Sapir's) were quickly institutionalized in communication studies.</font></a></font></td>

      universal grammar</i> essentially reversed all prior thinking 
      about how humans acquire language. Announcing that language skills are 
      innate, he began a new movement of language study as well as a career that 
      has spanned politics, communications, and more. According to a 1992 
      analysis of more than a decade of coverage in the Arts and Humanities 
      Citation Index, he is the most quoted scholar alive and the 8th most 
      quoted in the history of quoting. </font></a></td>

      circular and he warned of thinking of communication as &quot;starting somewhere 
      and ending somewhere.&quot; His leadership in the U. S. Office of War 
      Information in the 1940s and in the founding of the first doctoral degree 
      in communications led to his being called the founder of communications as 
      a field of study.</font></a></font></td>
