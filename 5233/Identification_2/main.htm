      Despite wide criticism of theory particulars, his theory of proxemics from 
      1966 (<i>The Hidden Dimension</i>) remains the classic literature base for 
      the vocabulary and general concepts for personal space as a part of 
      communication. Regardless of whether the 
      measure of 18 inches is correct, the theorist posited that in the most 
      intimate range, two people's &quot;thermal spheres&quot; may include mutual chemical 
      impact, producing connection of emotions.</font></a></font></td>

      gave us <i>the medium is the message</i> and <i>the world is a global 
      village.</i> This academic became a household word by the late 
      1960s, when television and magazines invoked his name and his theories in 
      examination of the influence of mass media.</font></a></font></td>

      <font face="Arial" color="#800000">His theory of Pragmatics, also 
      sometimes called the Interactional View, posited that communication has 
      two components: content and relational. When the components are not 
      aligned, miscommunication results. He also proposed that a person cannot 
      not communicate. Some interactional 
      theorists and practitioners agree that members of a family system can 
      change their communication&#151;but only with the help of an outsider.</font></a></font></td>

      world-famous semanticist was dubbed the Samurai Scholar when, in 1968, he 
      met SF State College protestors on their ground (the roof of a van) 
      and pulled the plug on their loud speakers. Despite continuing criticism 
      that the semanticist used his administrator's power rather than persuasion 
      to quiet his campus, he won popular approval on the campus, across the 
      State, and into the U.S. Senate.</font></a></font></td>
