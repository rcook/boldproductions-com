      <font face="Arial" color="#800000">She worked with Buller on the Interpersonal Deception Theory: while 
      humans are not very good liars, they are even worse lie detectors. A 
      strong bias for the truth makes most people assume they are hearing the 
      truth. When a speaker is concerned about being believed, nervousness may 
      emerge and related behavior may make a listener suspect a lie (when there 
      is none). This is most obvious when the listener considers himself/herself 
      a good judge of lying but that is another deception, a self-deception. 
      Even when on guard for lying, listeners 
      mis-judge more than half the time.</font></a></td>

      <a href="2.htm" target="right" style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#800000">This 
      small group theorist at the University of Minnesota proposed Symbolic 
      Convergence Theory, also known as Fantasy Theme Analysis, in 1992. A 
      group's cohesion is increased when members agree to discuss outside 
      issues,  producing a &quot;fantasy chain reaction&quot; and &quot;social convergence&quot; 
      (essentially, cohesion). The word fantasy refers to the creative and 
      imaginative interpretations that group members share after they learn more 
      about one another. For example, they may develop shared meanings of words 
      and symbols that produce understanding, laughter when uttered.</font></a></font></td>

      Culture: Stopping America's War of Words</i> (1999). Published since the

      1990 publication on Critical Mass Theory suggested that the natural 
      science concept of critical mass can be applied to interactive media. She 
      said that when the critical mass is reached, an organization can assume 
      universal access by its members. While critics maintain that access to 
      technology can never be assumed to be universal, the theory nevertheless 
      demonstrates that technology adoption shifts analysis (and attention) from 
      the individual to the group.</font></a></font></td>
