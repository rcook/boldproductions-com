My son was just diagnosed with it (literally).  My husband and I were told just last Friday.  I am now trying to understand the disorder better and think it presents an interesting challenge for the class to think about in terms of teaching and communication in the classroom.  My son's teacher did not pick up on my son's challenges.  I had to contact her about things I noticed and request that my son be tested.  I believe a great deal of Dyslexics slip through the cracks and never get diagnosed or diagnosed later in high school or college.

Should teachers be more aware of this disorder?  Should they suggest testing if they see signs warrenting it? 

What would a curriculum look like that is planned for Dyslexics?

<b>Comment by Mary Bold:</b><br>Dyslexia is often a "late" diagnosis. It is frequently put off due to the simple fact that virtually all children exhibit dyslexia. Of course, when the signs are persistent we know testing is in order. In previous generations, such a diagnosis was unheard of. Example in my home: Tom Bold. As a child, he simply knew to find a way to navigate school before his teachers could be irritated. For Tom, it was putting a wrist watch on a particular bedpost so that in the morning he would remember to put it on his right arm, which would remind him which direction was right&#133;and therefore which was left. That didn't solve all his problems, of course, but it was a pretty smart strategy for a kid to come up with.

I can imagine what frustration Tom felt as a boy. To have no knowledge of why hand-writing was so challenging must have been confusing for him. (With humor, I will add that his writing degraded to a scrawl in adulthood, anyway.) Adults can carry off dyslexia far more easily. Typically, it's only family who know special directions are needed ("it's the next right turn&#133;my side of the car").

What is encouraging about dyslexia is that it doesn't have to define the person. In spite of that challenge and the problems it presented at school, Tom Bold went on to earn two Master's degrees and a doctorate. I know he would have appreciated adult help in finding accommodations to the disorder; that would have made the journey easier.

As to one of your questions, what would a curriculum look like, I would suggest an introduction to <b>universal design</b>. It's not just for architects any more. We now also speak in terms of universal course design.
