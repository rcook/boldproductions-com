History:	The Kinsey Institute began its existence in 1947 as the Institute for Sex Research, Inc. (ISR) at Indiana University.  The creation of ISR stemmed from the research of an Indiana University zoologist, Dr. Alfred Kinsey. In 1938, Dr. Kinsey had been asked to design a course for students considering marriage. The creation of the course led Dr. Kinsey to begin a landmark sexuality research project that would culminate in the “Kinsey Reports”: Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953). Dr. Kinsey and his team of researchers utilized atypical research methods at that particular time. The key to Dr. Kinsey’s research was his interviewing process with study’s participants. By 1956, Dr. Kinsey had interviewed 7985 of the approximate 18,000 interviews conducted by his research team. Dr. Kinsey died in 1956, but his legacy of sexuality research continued through ISR. In 1981 the Institute was renamed The Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, Inc. on the 25th anniversary of Dr. Kinsey’s death.  In 1982, the Institute was again renamed, The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, Inc. Since its inception, The Kinsey Institute has actively engaged in research and scholarly publication regarding sexuality, gender and reproductive health. 

Mission:	The mission of the Kinsey Institute “is to promote interdisciplinary research and scholarship in the fields of human sexuality, gender, and reproduction” (The Kinsey Institute, 2004). The goals of The Kinsey Institute are achieved through a variety of methods: 
	
“development of specialized collections of resources for scholars; programs of research and publication; interdisciplinary conferences and seminars; provision of information services to researchers; and graduate training.”

The Kinsey Institute also strives to provide services to Indiana University and the profession through teaching and training, tours, presentations. The public is also served by the Institute through clinical services for problems related to sexual and reproductive health.

Funding: 	The Kinsey Institute has several main sources of funding. The University of Indiana provides funds through grants, gifts and bequests. Donations provide a significant component of the Institute’s ability to maintain and preserve its extensive library and special collection. Individuals may join the Friends of The Kinsey Institute to help support the Institute. Some individual research projects are funded in part by Federal grants.

Research:	The Kinsey Institute is focused on conducting research that contributes significant knowledge to the field of sexuality, gender and reproductive health.

Library and Collections:	The Kinsey Institute maintains an extensive library collection of scientific and scholarly works in the field of sexuality and gender research. Materials in the library include journals, erotic literature, film, video, magazines and many other mediums.  Also housed at the Institute is an art and artifact collection of approximately 7000 items. Photography collections of approximately 48,000 images have been collected to represent the period from the 1870’s to present. The film archive (8000 items) dates as early as 1915 through 1970. The video archive of approximately 4000 titles begins in the 1970’s and includes Beta, VHS and DVD collections.  Another significant collection maintained by the Kinsey Institute is the archive collection. This collection includes the papers of Dr. Kinsey, as well as materials from other institutes.  Some of Dr. Kinsey’s correspondence files are available to scholars for limited use. The archives collection also includes the University Archives and Oral History Research Center.

Education: The Kinsey Institute offers many educational opportunities. A PhD. Minor in Human Sexuality is offered through the Institute and Indiana University to students enrolled in doctoral programs of related disciplines. The Summer Institute provides an in-depth, weeklong research training opportunity in human sexuality. The Institute also provides an extensive list of Grants and Fellowships.
