Due to the way of selecting participants for the study, a large representation and diverse group of men participating made the study unique.

The study included 2,2881 telephone interviews that included the follwoing representation and diverse group of men:
-a more inclusive definition of men who have sex with men (MSMs)
-participants from four major cities: Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and New York
-participants residing in parts of the four cities other than just the "gay ghettos"
-men from places other than gay bars or "gay" venues
-phone interviews to men who nomrally avoided such studies, or are still in the "closet," or only occasionally have same-gender sex

The survey included a variety of topics that explored many important issues in the lives of gay/bisexual men.

Data from the study provided researchers and health professionals across the country with information needed for scientific papers and articles. Data provided the following information: Current rates of HIV infection, risk behavior, and risk prevention behavior, Comparing men who live in "gay ghettos" to men who live elsewhere in cities, The availability and use of antiretroviral drug regimens by HIV+ men, HIV testing and access to home test kits, Where MSMs go to meet other men, Links between prior experiences of coerced sex and curent sexual behavior, Rates of alcohol/drug use and abuse, Sex in public places (bars, bathhouses, or outdoors), Sense of wellbeing/emotional health and involement with the gay community, Rates of attempted suicide and relationship to key variables in coming out and HIV,  Caregiving and AIDS/HIV loss, Experiences of anti-gay violence and discrimination, Experiences of violence with male/male relationships.
