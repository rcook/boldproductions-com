<b>INTRODUCTION</b> 

The National Sexuality Resource Center opened on January 30, 2004. The center was a two-year developing project housed by the Human Sexuality Studies Program at the San Francisco State University and largely funded by Ford Foundation’s Education, Sexuality and Religion Program. The center is directed by Gilbert Herdt, PhD, a cultural anthropologist and a professor at San Francisco State University. His research includes adolescents and their families, the emergence of HIV within the gay culture, and the role that social policy plays in people’s sexual health. 

The NSRC provides a diverse amount of resources and educational tools to educate society about various areas within Sexuality.
