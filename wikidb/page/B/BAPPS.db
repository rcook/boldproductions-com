BAPPS-Bridge for Adolescent Pregnancy, Parenting and Sexuality</b><br><br>

Bridge for Adolescent Pregnancy, Parenting and Sexuality (BAPPS) is a workgroup of the Children’s Youth and Families Education and Research Network (CYFERnet), which is funded by the Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Its purpose is to create a bridge across the Cooperative Extension System, which includes the National Network for Family Resiliency (NNFR) and the National Network for Health (NNH).<br><br>
	
This special interest group is committed to making an impact in our communities and in the lives of teenagers and their families through the dissemination of research and the development of curriculum.  The workgroup is also dedicated to working with federal and State Stakeholders in an effort to educate, create awareness, implement community-based programs and provide research based curricula for the 3 focus issues of adolescent pregnancy, parenting and sexuality.<br><br>

BAPPS recognizes the need for education in both male and female adolescents as well as their parents (http://www.bapps.org). The organization is divided into three sub- work groups.   Each individual workgroups’ goal is to provide programs that will give individuals the resources and access to current research in the areas of teen pregnancy, parenting and sexuality.<br><br>  
 
The pregnancy workgroups’ ideal goal is to prevent adolescent pregnancy but also focuses on helping teens to enhance their roles as parents through education and planning, and teaching accountability. The parenting workgroups’ goal is to provide programs that address the needs of the teen parent.  Issues such as conflict resolution, self esteem, and work experience and child development education are just a few of the concerns of teen parents that if addressed adequately could help foster successful parenting.  This group works to increase sensitivity and awareness to these issues and implementing programs that will address them.  The sexuality workgroups, major concern is to help develop programs that will aid parents and educators in the creation of healthy sexual identities and behaviors among teens.<br><br>  

To name a few, ongoing projects include:<br><br>

-Parenting Teens: What Works? Multi-state research collaboration with adolescent parents between the ages of 13 and 19 years.  This projects focus is to develop understanding of the needs of teen parents.<br><br>  
 

-Building Partnerships for Youth: which is a 5 year project that is aimed at helping kids 9-13 years old make healthy choices (www.bapps.org/BAPPS%20projects.pdf).<br><br>

There are also HIV programs such as the Missouri based programs, Get Real About Aids and Reducing the Risk.  The curricula/programs also extend to issues such as teen violence and gay and lesbian and transgender issues.<br><br>

Many of the issues that teens face such as pregnancy, teen parenting and sexuality are not likely to disappear.  Organizations such as BAPPS are extremely important and necessary to help facilitate a successful environment for the growth and development of the children of adolescent parents.  Education and understanding are the greatest tools that we have in conquering these very critical issues in our society.<br><br>
