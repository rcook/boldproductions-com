1. <b>Clickers</b> are remote-controlled devices that allow students to send their responses to multiple choice and true-false questions, via radio frequency (rf) technology, to a receiver connected to the instructor's laptop computer. Software installed on the computer analyzes the data and displays the results graphically (bar graphs, pie charts, etc.), giving both students and faculty a quick idea of what concepts might need further review or preparation. UT Knoxville has adopted the Classroom Performance System (CPSrf) “clicker” developed by eInstruction.
