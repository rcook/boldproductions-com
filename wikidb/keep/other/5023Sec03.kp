Right now, the pages listed below are ready for you to type in (or copy/paste from your own Word document) the text of your sub-report. Do NOT try to do the formatting yet. (If you already know how, that's great! If you don't, that's OK. We'll work on it later.)

To put your text into your page:
1 - Click on the letters (in the list below) to go to your page.

I'm pushing Houser to "run tech" on this project, so she will be learning the how-to of the wiki just a few steps ahead of you. I am <i>exceedingly proud</i> of this section for being self-reliant and active. Your work in this venue will definitely raise the bar for our graduate classes. I'll be around to help, and you will find Amy an expert on this in, oh, about 17 minutes. ~ Mary Bold

I'm pushing Houser to "run tech" on this project, so she will be learning the how-to of the wiki just a few steps ahead of you. I am <i>exceedingly proud</i> of this section for being self-reliant and active. Your work in this venue will definitely raise the bar for our graduate classes. I'll be around to help, and you will find Amy an expert on this in, oh, about 17 minutes. ~ Mary Bold
