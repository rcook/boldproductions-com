The denial of the doctrine of the Blank Slate as Pinker imagines it has interesting and very promising implications for gender relations.  Traditionally, it has been assumed that any defense of the idea of biological and evolutionary differences between men and women would lead down a slippery slope that would ultimately reinforce the subordination of women personally, culturally and politically.  Pinker states repeatedly throughout The Blank Slate (especially in the chapter titled “Gender”) that upon examination, the Blank Slate--with its guarantee of an equal start for all of humanity--has afforded no such protection.  Sexism and oppression of women have occurred even in the absence of any type of serious theoretical and/or practical endorsement of the idea of innate differences between men and women.  

Evolutionary psychology, in direct contrast to the Blank Slate, is often criticized for being anti-feminist, but this criticism is unfounded.  What it really does is challenge the intellectual institution of feminism.  As Pinker points out, if the goal of feminism is to effectively end sexual discrimination and exploitation, then a theory that addresses the differences in psychology and reproduction between and among men and women has much appeal and need not be used as a way to judge economic or political worth.  Thus, as he also explains in How the Mind Works (1997), the feminist movement would remain a defensible ethical and political position and simultaneously be able to address the realities of gender and gender relations without being refuted by any scientific theory or discovery.  

A human nature-friendly theory base does not challenge the goals of feminism, the most important of which is equality.  Rather, it posits the idea the individuals are not interchangeable and reinforces the moral principle that people should not be judged on the basis of the average or stereotyped properties of their group.  From Pinker’s perspective (and the evolutionary biology perspective) there is a “genetic equality of the sexes” because natural selection has favored equal biological investment of both sexes.  Another equally important point that he makes is that when we apply a biological lens to the study of gender, such examination in no way undercuts the effects of socialization on gender.  After all, genes are only part of the story.  What Pinker does warn against is the tendency among feminists (and many other theorists) to overemphasize the effects of socialization on gender as though that were the only possible explanation for gender differences.  In Pinker’s theory then, we may find the best of both worlds.  

It seems only fair to point out that Pinker is quite critical of the feminist movement throughout The Blank Slate.  Sometimes the criticism is warranted and sometimes it is not considering the diversity of feminist theories.  Many contemporary feminists already advocate a theory that is sensitive to human nature and the differences between the genders (Osmond & Thorne, 1993).  Nevertheless, Pinker’s revision of feminist theory is commendable and the new feminism as Pinker imagines it is a force to be reckoned with.  The implications for improving upon existing feminist theories are clear.  And as many of us know, improving the theories by which we come to understand human relations will only serve to improve those relations in the long run.  Pinker has succeeded in giving us a rational, applicable, common sense approach to gender relations.

Pinker states repeatedly throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i> (especially in the chapter titled “Gender”) that upon examination, the Blank Slate--with its guarantee of an equal start for all of humanity--has afforded no such protection.  Sexism and oppression of women have occurred even in the absence of any type of serious theoretical and/or practical endorsement of the idea of innate differences between men and women.  

Evolutionary psychology, in direct contrast to the Blank Slate, is often criticized for being anti-feminist, but this criticism is unfounded.  What it really does is challenge the intellectual institution of feminism.  As Pinker points out, if the goal of feminism is to effectively end sexual discrimination and exploitation, then a theory that addresses the differences in psychology and reproduction between and among men and women has much appeal and need not be used as a way to judge economic or political worth.  Thus, as he also explains in <i>How the Mind Works</i> (1997), the feminist movement would remain a defensible ethical and political position and <i>simultaneously</i> be able to address the realities of gender and gender relations without being refuted by any scientific theory or discovery.  

A human nature-friendly theory base does not challenge the goals of feminism, the most important of which is equality.  Rather, it posits the idea the individuals are not interchangeable and reinforces the moral principle that people should not be judged on the basis of the average or stereotyped properties of their group.  From Pinker’s perspective (and the evolutionary biology perspective) there is a “genetic equality of the sexes” because natural selection has favored equal biological investment of both sexes.  Another equally important point that he makes is that when we apply a biological lens to the study of gender, such examination in no way undercuts the effects of socialization on gender.  After all, genes are only part of the story.  What Pinker does warn against is the tendency among feminists (and many other theorists) to <i>overemphasize</i> the effects of socialization on gender as though that were the only possible explanation for gender differences.  In Pinker’s theory then, we may find the best of both worlds.  

It seems only fair to point out that Pinker is quite critical of the feminist movement throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i>.  Sometimes the criticism is warranted and sometimes it is not considering the diversity of feminist theories.  Many contemporary feminists already advocate a theory that is sensitive to human nature and the differences between the genders (Osmond & Thorne, 1993).  Nevertheless, Pinker’s revision of feminist theory is commendable and the new feminism as Pinker imagines it is a force to be reckoned with.  The implications for improving upon existing feminist theories are clear.  And as many of us know, improving the theories by which we come to understand human relations will only serve to improve those relations in the long run.  Pinker has succeeded in giving us a rational, applicable, common sense approach to gender relations.

Thus, as he also explains in <i>How the Mind Works</i> (1997), the feminist movement would remain a defensible ethical and political position and <i>simultaneously</i> be able to address the realities of gender and gender relations without being refuted by any scientific theory or discovery.  

A human nature-friendly theory base does not challenge the goals of feminism, the most important of which is equality.  Rather, it posits the idea the individuals are not interchangeable and reinforces the moral principle that people should not be judged on the basis of the average or stereotyped properties of their group.  From Pinker’s perspective (and the evolutionary biology perspective) there is a “genetic equality of the sexes” because natural selection has favored equal biological investment of both sexes.  Another equally important point that he makes is that when we apply a biological lens to the study of gender, such examination in no way undercuts the effects of socialization on gender.  After all, genes are only part of the story.  What Pinker does warn against is the tendency among feminists (and many other theorists) to <i>overemphasize</i> the effects of socialization on gender as though that were the only possible explanation for gender differences.  In Pinker’s theory then, we may find the best of both worlds.  

It seems only fair to point out that Pinker is quite critical of the feminist movement throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i>.  Sometimes the criticism is warranted and sometimes it is not considering the diversity of feminist theories.  Many contemporary feminists already advocate a theory that is sensitive to human nature and the differences between the genders (Osmond & Thorne, 1993).  Nevertheless, Pinker’s revision of feminist theory is commendable and the new feminism as Pinker imagines it is a force to be reckoned with.  The implications for improving upon existing feminist theories are clear.  And as many of us know, improving the theories by which we come to understand human relations will only serve to improve those relations in the long run.  Pinker has succeeded in giving us a rational, applicable, common sense approach to gender relations.

The denial of the doctrine of the Blank Slate as Pinker imagines it has interesting and very promising implications for gender relations.  Traditionally, it has been assumed that any defense of the idea of biological and evolutionary differences between men and women would lead down a slippery slope that would ultimately reinforce the subordination of women personally, culturally and politically.  Pinker states repeatedly throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i> (especially in the chapter titled “Gender”) that upon examination, the Blank Slate--with its guarantee of an equal start for all of humanity--has afforded no such protection.  Sexism and oppression of women have occurred even in the absence of any type of serious theoretical and/or practical endorsement of the idea of innate differences between men and women.  

Evolutionary psychology, in direct contrast to the Blank Slate, is often criticized for being anti-feminist, but this criticism is unfounded.  What it really does is challenge the intellectual institution of feminism.  As Pinker points out, if the goal of feminism is to effectively end sexual discrimination and exploitation, then a theory that addresses the differences in psychology and reproduction between and among men and women has much appeal and need not be used as a way to judge economic or political worth.

Sexism and oppression of women have occurred even in the absence of any type of serious theoretical and/or practical endorsement of the idea of innate differences between men and women.  

Evolutionary psychology, in direct contrast to the Blank Slate, is often criticized for being anti-feminist, but this criticism is unfounded.  What it really does is challenge the intellectual institution of feminism.  As Pinker points out, if the goal of feminism is to effectively end sexual discrimination and exploitation, then a theory that addresses the differences in psychology and reproduction between and among men and women has much appeal and need not be used as a way to judge economic or political worth.  Thus, as he also explains in <i>How the Mind Works</i> (1997), the feminist movement would remain a defensible ethical and political position and <i>simultaneously</i> be able to address the realities of gender and gender relations without being refuted by any scientific theory or discovery.  

A human nature-friendly theory base does not challenge the goals of feminism, the most important of which is equality.  Rather, it posits the idea the individuals are not interchangeable and reinforces the moral principle that people should not be judged on the basis of the average or stereotyped properties of their group.  From Pinker’s perspective (and the evolutionary biology perspective) there is a “genetic equality of the sexes” because natural selection has favored equal biological investment of both sexes.  Another equally important point that he makes is that when we apply a biological lens to the study of gender, such examination in no way undercuts the effects of socialization on gender.  After all, genes are only part of the story.  What Pinker does warn against is the tendency among feminists (and many other theorists) to <i>overemphasize</i> the effects of socialization on gender as though that were the only possible explanation for gender differences.  In Pinker’s theory then, we may find the best of both worlds.  

It seems only fair to point out that Pinker is quite critical of the feminist movement throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i>.  Sometimes the criticism is warranted and sometimes it is not considering the diversity of feminist theories.  Many contemporary feminists already advocate a theory that is sensitive to human nature and the differences between the genders (Osmond & Thorne, 1993).  Nevertheless, Pinker’s revision of feminist theory is commendable and the new feminism as Pinker imagines it is a force to be reckoned with.  The implications for improving upon existing feminist theories are clear.  And as many of us know, improving the theories by which we come to understand human relations will only serve to improve those relations in the long run.  Pinker has succeeded in giving us a rational, applicable, common sense approach to gender relations.

The denial of the doctrine of the Blank Slate as Pinker imagines it has interesting and very promising implications for gender relations.  Traditionally, it has been assumed that any defense of the idea of biological and evolutionary differences between men and women would lead down a slippery slope that would ultimately reinforce the subordination of women personally, culturally and politically.  Pinker states repeatedly throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i> (especially in the chapter titled “Gender”) that upon examination, the Blank Slate--with its guarantee of an equal start for all of humanity--has afforded no such protection.  Sexism and oppression of women have occurred even in the absence of any type of serious theoretical and/or practical endorsement of the idea of innate differences between men and women.  

Evolutionary psychology, in direct contrast to the Blank Slate, is often criticized for being anti-feminist, but this criticism is unfounded.  What it really does is challenge the intellectual institution of feminism.  As Pinker points out, if the goal of feminism is to effectively end sexual discrimination and exploitation, then a theory that addresses the differences in psychology and reproduction between and among men and women has much appeal and need not be used as a way to judge economic or political worth.  Thus, as he also explains in <i>How the Mind Works</i> (1997), the feminist movement would remain a defensible ethical and political position and <i>simultaneously</i> be able to address the realities of gender and gender relations without being refuted by any scientific theory or discovery.  

A human nature-friendly theory base does not challenge the goals of feminism, the most important of which is equality.  Rather, it posits the idea the individuals are not interchangeable and reinforces the moral principle that people should not be judged on the basis of the average or stereotyped properties of their group.  From Pinker’s perspective (and the evolutionary biology perspective) there is a “genetic equality of the sexes” because natural selection has favored equal biological investment of both sexes.  Another equally important point that he makes is that when we apply a biological lens to the study of gender, such examination in no way undercuts the effects of socialization on gender.  After all, genes are only part of the story.  What Pinker does warn against is the tendency among feminists (and many other theorists) to <i>overemphasize</i> the effects of socialization on gender as though that were the only possible explanation for gender differences.  In Pinker’s theory then, we may find the best of both worlds.  

It seems only fair to point out that Pinker is quite critical of the feminist movement throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i>.  Sometimes the criticism is warranted and sometimes it is not considering the diversity of feminist theories.  Many contemporary feminists already advocate a theory that is sensitive to human nature and the differences between the genders (Osmond & Thorne, 1993).  Nevertheless, Pinker’s revision of feminist theory is commendable and the new feminism as Pinker imagines it is a force to be reckoned with.  The implications for improving upon existing feminist theories are clear.  And as many of us know, improving the theories by which we come to understand human relations will only serve to improve those relations in the long run.  Pinker has succeeded in giving us a rational, applicable, common sense approach to gender relations.

The denial of the doctrine of the Blank Slate as Pinker imagines it has interesting and very promising implications for gender relations.  Traditionally, it has been assumed that any defense of the idea of biological and evolutionary differences between men and women would lead down a slippery slope that would ultimately reinforce the subordination of women personally, culturally and politically.  Pinker states repeatedly throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i> (especially in the chapter titled “Gender”) that upon examination, the Blank Slate--with its guarantee of an equal start for all of humanity--has afforded no such protection.  Sexism and oppression of women have occurred even in the absence of any type of serious theoretical and/or practical endorsement of the idea of innate differences between men and women.  

Evolutionary psychology, in direct contrast to the Blank Slate, is often criticized for being anti-feminist, but this criticism is unfounded.  What it really does is challenge the intellectual institution of feminism.  As Pinker points out, if the goal of feminism is to effectively end sexual discrimination and exploitation, then a theory that addresses the differences in psychology and reproduction between and among men and women has much appeal and need not be used as a way to judge economic or political worth.  Thus, as he also explains in <i>How the Mind Works</i> (1997), the feminist movement would remain a defensible ethical and political position and <i>simultaneously</i> be able to address the realities of gender and gender relations without being refuted by any scientific theory or discovery.  

A human nature-friendly theory base does not challenge the goals of feminism, the most important of which is equality.  Rather, it posits the idea the individuals are not interchangeable and reinforces the moral principle that people should not be judged on the basis of the average or stereotyped properties of their group.  From Pinker’s perspective (and the evolutionary biology perspective) there is a “genetic equality of the sexes” because natural selection has favored equal biological investment of both sexes.  Another equally important point that he makes is that when we apply a biological lens to the study of gender, such examination in no way undercuts the effects of socialization on gender.  After all, genes are only part of the story.  What Pinker does warn against is the tendency among feminists (and many other theorists) to <i>overemphasize</i> the effects of socialization on gender as though that were the only possible explanation for gender differences.  In Pinker’s theory then, we may find the best of both worlds.  

It seems only fair to point out that Pinker is quite critical of the feminist movement throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i>.  Sometimes the criticism is warranted and sometimes it is not considering the diversity of feminist theories.  Many contemporary feminists already advocate a theory that is sensitive to human nature and the differences between the genders (Osmond & Thorne, 1993).  Nevertheless, Pinker’s revision of feminist theory is commendable and the new feminism as Pinker imagines it is a force to be reckoned with.  The implications for improving upon existing feminist theories are clear.  And as many of us know, improving the theories by which we come to understand human relations will only serve to improve those relations in the long run.  Pinker has succeeded in giving us a rational, applicable, common sense approach to gender relations.

The denial of the doctrine of the Blank Slate as Pinker imagines it has interesting and very promising implications for gender relations.  Traditionally, it has been assumed that any defense of the idea of biological and evolutionary differences between men and women would lead down a slippery slope that would ultimately reinforce the subordination of women personally, culturally and politically.  Pinker states repeatedly throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i> (especially in the chapter titled “Gender”) that upon examination, the Blank Slate--with its guarantee of an equal start for all of humanity--has afforded no such protection.  Sexism and oppression of women have occurred even in the absence of any type of serious theoretical and/or practical endorsement of the idea of innate differences between men and women.  

Evolutionary psychology, in direct contrast to the Blank Slate, is often criticized for being anti-feminist, but this criticism is unfounded.  What it really does is challenge the intellectual institution of feminism.  As Pinker points out, if the goal of feminism is to effectively end sexual discrimination and exploitation, then a theory that addresses the differences in psychology and reproduction between and among men and women has much appeal and need not be used as a way to judge economic or political worth.  Thus, as he also explains in <i>How the Mind Works</i> (1997), the feminist movement would remain a defensible ethical and political position and <i>simultaneously</i> be able to address the realities of gender and gender relations without being refuted by any scientific theory or discovery.  

A human nature-friendly theory base does not challenge the goals of feminism, the most important of which is equality.  Rather, it posits the idea the individuals are not interchangeable and reinforces the moral principle that people should not be judged on the basis of the average or stereotyped properties of their group.  From Pinker’s perspective (and the evolutionary biology perspective) there is a “genetic equality of the sexes” because natural selection has favored equal biological investment of both sexes.  Another equally important point that he makes is that when we apply a biological lens to the study of gender, such examination in no way undercuts the effects of socialization on gender.  After all, genes are only part of the story.  What Pinker does warn against is the tendency among feminists (and many other theorists) to <i>overemphasize</i> the effects of socialization on gender as though that were the only possible explanation for gender differences.  In Pinker’s theory then, we may find the best of both worlds.  

It seems only fair to point out that Pinker is quite critical of the feminist movement throughout <i>The Blank Slate</i>.  Sometimes the criticism is warranted and sometimes it is not considering the diversity of feminist theories.  Many contemporary feminists already advocate a theory that is sensitive to human nature and the differences between the genders (Osmond & Thorne, 1993).  Nevertheless, Pinker’s revision of feminist theory is commendable and the new feminism as Pinker imagines it is a force to be reckoned with.  The implications for improving upon existing feminist theories are clear.  And as many of us know, improving the theories by which we come to understand human relations will only serve to improve those relations in the long run.  Pinker has succeeded in giving us a rational, applicable, common sense approach to gender relations.
