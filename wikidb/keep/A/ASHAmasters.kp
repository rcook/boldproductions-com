The ASHA vision includes public awareness, patient education and support, health policy and provider training. The focus is improving the health of individuals, families and communities by preventing sexually transmitted diseases and the harmful consequences caused by them. The American Social Health Association's core values include integrity, professionalism, diversity, collaboration and effectiveness.<br><br>__Integrity - Lead by example, keep commitments, link action to vision, act ethically, and accountable for their processes and results. <br><br>__Professionalism - Cultivate leadership and professional skills, learn from success and failure, and place the mission of ASHA above personal agendas. <br><br>__Diversity - Embrace contributions, empathize with others, and draw on diversity.<br><br>__Collaboration - Listen actively, cultivate teamwork, seek input from everyone, resolve conflict equally, and reward success.<br><br>__Effectiveness - Use input from everyone, mentor others, share knowledge, innovate, focus, and promote achievement.<br><br><b>Goals of ASHA</b><br><br>ASHA is at the front position in providing precise and up to date information about STDs to the public, health care providers and policy makers.
