<b>Child Development and Parenting</b>

“Parents wield enormous power over their children, and their actions can make a big difference to their happiness. Childbearing is above all an ethical responsibility.  It is not OK for parents to beat, humiliate, deprive, or neglect their children, because those are awful things for a strong person to do to a small helpless one.” (Pinker, 2002,p.398)


When studying the development of children,  the three laws of behavioral genetics should be examined.  Although they are not totally accepted by most psychologists, they set a foundation for the argument of nature versus nurture.   
	
<i>The First Law:  All human behavioral traits are heritable.</i>
Behavioral traits are those traits that can be measured through psychological tests such as IQ tests and personality tests.  The results of these test prove valid because they give the same results each time a person is tested.  Heritability is coupled with genetic differences.  Behavioral genetics often focuses on the study of twins. The study of identical twins that are separated at birth, and raised by different families, show  good examples of the connection between behavioral traits and genetics.  The only common link they have is their genes, and yet they display some of the same behavior traits.  Where as adoptive siblings can grow up in the same environment and have very different behavior traits.  There are concrete behavioral traits that are no heritable, these traits are influenced by culture and environment, such the language you use or the religion you practice. A person’s intelligence is heritable, as well as a person’s personality.  These personality traits for example, conscientiousness, extroversion/introversion, and neuroticism can be considered heritable.  There are limitation to behavioral genetics methods,  they tend to explain only the differences, they have little variation in the group being studied (ex. an all white, middle-class sample), and results show correlations but not the factors that cause the correlations.




<i>The Second Law:  The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of the genes.</i>
Our genes do cause a difference in people.  Because of our genes we are different than our neighbors, even members of our own families.   The environment also is a factor in a person’s traits.  There are two different types of environments that play a role in behavioral genetics, the shared environment and the unique environment.  The shared environment are those things that not only affect a child and his or her siblings such as parents and home life.  The unique environment are events and experiences that effect one particular child, for example, parental favoritism, or breaking an arm.
The most successful way to measure the effect of shared environments on  children is through a Twin study.  The shared experiences of child siblings have little effect on the type of people they become.

<i>The Third Law:  A substantial portion of the variation in the complex human behavioral traits is not accounted for by the effects of the genes or families.</i> 
The third law follows the first two, with added questions.  If genes do not count for all behaviortraits, and enviorment does not count for all brhavior traits, there must be something else. Causes. There are causes that are not related to genetics or family environment that distinguish people, causes that have no explanation. 


 It was Judith Rich Harris who highlighted and promoted the three laws.  Harris implied that childrearing experts had been wrong about parenting advice.  Up until this point,  parents believed that they controlled their children’s fate.  It was their responsibility to guide their children.
Parents wanted the best for their children, they wanted them to be popular, make good grades, be self-confident, avoid “bad” things such as drugs and alcohol and become successful.  They were told to stimulate their babies by diverse experiences, enhance their child’s  language development by an abundance of communication.  Parents should set limitations, be firm, and flexible.  Children needed unconditional love and support. Parents should also be involved in their child’s everyday life.

It was Judith Rich Harris who highlighted and published the three laws of behavioral genetics.  Harris implied that childrearing experts had been wrong about parenting advice.  Up until this point,  parenting theories 
Focuses on the effects that parents and their actions had on their children.
Some beliefs during the twentieth century were that children are shaped by contingencies of reinforcements; mothers could be blamed for psychological disorders, and most predominate, parents were lead to believed that they controlled their children’s fate.  It was their responsibility to guide their children.  During this time parents were bomb bared by parenting information.  Harris’ belief in the three laws, threw the parenting community, especially experts, in tail-spin.  Harris’ beliefs were a contradiction to everything parents had been told over the years.  
They were not the key to their childrens’ happiness and success.

In Harris’s book The Nurture Assumption, beliefs focus on who was in a person’s environment, and the influence of peers on a person’s development. Harris believes that parent’s influence over a child’s development was minimal.  For support, she discussed the outcomes of siblings that were rendered by the same parents.  The difference in siblings shows proof that parenting has less effect than one would have thought. Harris does not wholly discard heredity, genes and the influences of family.
Harris does believes that it is the peer group that influences a person’s development and character more than other factors.  Harris’s theory known as Group Socialization, examine how the elusive environment shapes an individual’s personality.  Group Socialization is attaining the skills that are necessary in being a positive member of society.   A person’s traits are developed through socialization within their peer group.   Children interact in a society of their own, a develop through interactions that help form their identities, and strive to become better individuals.

There are other factors that other experts believe effects the development of traits (behavioral and personality). Chances and the concept of “fate” can attribute to human development, and  one cannot dismiss the idea of  our personalities be “biologically determined”.

Pinker agrees with Harris about the importance of children socializing and that they learn values and skills from their peers.  He does differ in his beliefs about children acquiring their personalities through socialization.  Pinker believes that  out of the many factors mentioned, genes, family or peer groups, not one can explain the differences between individuals.  Pinker believes that because of this “chance in development” plays a larger role than expected.

Harris’s  theory known as Group Socialization, examine how the elusive environment shapes an individual’s personality.  Group Socialization is attaining the skills that are necessary in being a positive member of society.   A person’s traits are developed through socialization within their peer group.   Children interact in a society of their own, a develop through interactions that help form their identities, and strive to become better individuals.

There are other factors that other experts believe effects the development of traits (behavioral and personality). Chances and the concept of “fate” can attribute to human development, and  one cannot dismiss the idea of  our personalities be “biologically determined”.

Pinker agrees with Harris about the importance of children socializing and that they learn values and skills from their peers.  He does differ in his beliefs about children acquiring their personalities through socialization.  Pinker believes that  out of the factors mentioned, genes, family or peer groups, not one can explain the differences between individuals.  Pinker believes that because of this “chance in development” plays a larger role than expected.   

The development of a child’s behavioral and personality traits has many factors including genetics, parenting, and environment, and yes even “chance”.  Nature versus nurture, there is no simple answer.

When studying Pinker’s views on the development of children and parenting,  the three laws of behavioral genetics should be examined.  Although they are not totally accepted by most psychologists, they set a foundation for the argument of nature versus nurture.   
	
<i>The First Law:  All human behavioral traits are heritable.</i>
Behavioral traits are those traits that can be measured through psychological tests such as IQ tests and personality tests.  The results of these test prove valid because they give the same results each time a person is tested.  Heritability is coupled with genetic differences.  Behavioral genetics often focuses on the study of twins. The study of identical twins that are separated at birth, and raised by different families, show  good examples of the connection between behavioral traits and genetics.  The only common link they have is their genes, and yet they display some of the same behavior traits.  Where as adoptive siblings can grow up in the same environment and have very different behavior traits.  There are concrete behavioral traits that are no heritable, these traits are influenced by culture and environment, such the language you use or the religion you practice. A person’s intelligence is heritable, as well as a person’s personality.  These personality traits for example, conscientiousness, extroversion/introversion, and neuroticism can be considered heritable.  There are limitation to behavioral genetics methods,  they tend to explain only the differences, they have little variation in the group being studied (ex. a sample will be  all white, middle-class), and results show correlations but not the factors that cause the correlations.

<i>The Second Law:  The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of the genes.</i>
Our genes do cause a difference in people.  Because of our genes we are different than our neighbors, even members of our own families.   The environment also is a factor in a person’s traits.  There are two different types of environments that play a role in behavioral genetics, the shared environment and the unique environment.  The shared environment are those things that not only affect a child and his or her siblings such as parents and home life.  The unique environment are events and experiences that effect one particular child, for example, parental favoritism, or breaking an arm.
The most successful way to measure the effect of shared environments on  children is through a Twin study.  The shared experiences of child siblings have little effect on the type of people they become.

<i>The Third Law:  A substantial portion of the variation in the complex human behavioral traits is not accounted for by the effects of the genes or families.</i> 
The third law follows the first two, with added questions.  If genes do not count for all behavior traits, and environment does not count for all behavior traits, there must be something else. Causes. There are causes that are not related to genetics or family environment that distinguish people, causes that have no explanation. 

It was Judith Rich Harris who highlighted and published the three laws of behavioral genetics for the public to see.  Harris implied that childrearing experts had been wrong about parenting advice.  Up until this point,  parenting theories focused on the effects that parents and their actions had on their children. Some beliefs during the twentieth century were that children are shaped by contingencies of reinforcements; mothers could be blamed for psychological disorders, and most predominate, parents were lead to believed that they controlled their children’s fate.  It was their responsibility to guide their children.  During this time parents were bomb bared by parenting information.  Harris’ belief in the three laws, threw the parenting community, especially experts, in tail-spin.  Harris’ beliefs were a contradiction to everything parents had been told over the years.  
They were not the key to their children’s’ happiness and success.

Pinker agrees with Harris about the importance of children socializing and that they learn values and skills from their peers.  He does differ in his beliefs about children acquiring their personalities through socialization.  Pinker believes that  out of the factors mentioned, genes, family or peer groups, not one can explain the differences between individuals.  Pinker believes that because of this “chance in development” plays a larger role than expected.   

The development of a child’s behavioral and personality traits has many factors including genetics, parenting, and environment, and yes even “chance”.  Nature versus nurture, there is no simple answer.

<center><b>Pinker on Child Development and Parenting</b></center><br><center>by Darlene Filar</center><br>

When studying Pinker’s views on the development of children and parenting,  the three laws of behavioral genetics should be examined.  Although they are not totally accepted by most psychologists, they set a foundation for the argument of nature versus nurture.   
	
<i>The First Law:  All human behavioral traits are heritable.</i>
Behavioral traits are those traits that can be measured through psychological tests such as IQ tests and personality tests.  The results of these test prove valid because they give the same results each time a person is tested.  Heritability is coupled with genetic differences.  Behavioral genetics often focuses on the study of twins. The study of identical twins that are separated at birth, and raised by different families, show  good examples of the connection between behavioral traits and genetics.  The only common link they have is their genes, and yet they display some of the same behavior traits.  Where as adoptive siblings can grow up in the same environment and have very different behavior traits.  There are concrete behavioral traits that are no heritable, these traits are influenced by culture and environment, such the language you use or the religion you practice. A person’s intelligence is heritable, as well as a person’s personality.  These personality traits for example, conscientiousness, extroversion/introversion, and neuroticism can be considered heritable.  There are limitation to behavioral genetics methods,  they tend to explain only the differences, they have little variation in the group being studied (ex. a sample will be  all white, middle-class), and results show correlations but not the factors that cause the correlations.

<i>The Second Law:  The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of the genes.</i>
Our genes do cause a difference in people.  Because of our genes we are different than our neighbors, even members of our own families.   The environment also is a factor in a person’s traits.  There are two different types of environments that play a role in behavioral genetics, the shared environment and the unique environment.  The shared environment are those things that not only affect a child and his or her siblings such as parents and home life.  The unique environment are events and experiences that effect one particular child, for example, parental favoritism, or breaking an arm.
The most successful way to measure the effect of shared environments on  children is through a Twin study.  The shared experiences of child siblings have little effect on the type of people they become.

<i>The Third Law:  A substantial portion of the variation in the complex human behavioral traits is not accounted for by the effects of the genes or families.</i> 
The third law follows the first two, with added questions.  If genes do not count for all behavior traits, and environment does not count for all behavior traits, there must be something else.

The study of identical twins that are separated at birth, and raised by different families, show  good examples of the connection between behavioral traits and genetics.  The only common link they have is their genes, and yet they display some of the same behavior traits.  Where as adoptive siblings can grow up in the same environment and have very different behavior traits.  There are concrete behavioral traits that are no heritable, these traits are influenced by culture and environment, such the language you use or the religion you practice. A person’s intelligence is heritable, as well as a person’s personality.  These personality traits for example, conscientiousness, extroversion/introversion, and neuroticism can be considered heritable.  There are limitation to behavioral genetics methods,  they tend to explain only the differences, they have little variation in the group being studied (ex. a sample will be  all white, middle-class), and results show correlations but not the factors that cause the correlations.

<i>The Second Law:  The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of the genes.</i>
Our genes do cause a difference in people.  Because of our genes we are different than our neighbors, even members of our own families.   The environment also is a factor in a person’s traits.  There are two different types of environments that play a role in behavioral genetics, the shared environment and the unique environment.  The shared environment are those things that not only affect a child and his or her siblings such as parents and home life.  The unique environment are events and experiences that effect one particular child, for example, parental favoritism, or breaking an arm.
The most successful way to measure the effect of shared environments on  children is through a Twin study.  The shared experiences of child siblings have little effect on the type of people they become.

<i>The Third Law:  A substantial portion of the variation in the complex human behavioral traits is not accounted for by the effects of the genes or families.</i> 
The third law follows the first two, with added questions.  If genes do not count for all behavior traits, and environment does not count for all behavior traits, there must be something else. Causes. There are causes that are not related to genetics or family environment that distinguish people, causes that have no explanation. 

It was Judith Rich Harris who highlighted and published the three laws of behavioral genetics for the public to see.  Harris implied that childrearing experts had been wrong about parenting advice.  Up until this point,  parenting theories focused on the effects that parents and their actions had on their children. Some beliefs during the twentieth century were that children are shaped by contingencies of reinforcements; mothers could be blamed for psychological disorders, and most predominate, parents were lead to believed that they controlled their children’s fate.  It was their responsibility to guide their children.  During this time parents were bomb bared by parenting information.  Harris’ belief in the three laws, threw the parenting community, especially experts, in tail-spin.  Harris’ beliefs were a contradiction to everything parents had been told over the years.  
They were not the key to their children’s’ happiness and success.

In Harris’s book The Nurture Assumption, beliefs focus on who was in a person’s environment, and the influence of peers on a person’s development.  

Harris believed that parent’s influence over a child’s development was minimal.  It is the peer group that influences a person’s development and character more than other factors.  Harris’s  theory known as Group Socialization, examine how the elusive environment shapes an individual’s personality.  Group Socialization is attaining the skills that are necessary in being a positive member of society.   A person’s traits are developed through socialization within their peer group.   Children interact in a society of their own, a develop through interactions that help form their identities, and strive to become better individuals.

There are other factors that other experts believe effects the development of traits (behavioral and personality). Chances and the concept of “fate” can attribute to human development, and  one cannot dismiss the idea of  our personalities be “biologically determined”.

Pinker agrees with Harris about the importance of children socializing and that they learn values and skills from their peers.  He does differ in his beliefs about children acquiring their personalities through socialization.  Pinker believes that  out of the factors mentioned, genes, family or peer groups, not one can explain the differences between individuals.  Pinker believes that because of this “chance in development” plays a larger role than expected.   

The development of a child’s behavioral and personality traits has many factors including genetics, parenting, and environment, and yes even “chance”.  Nature versus nurture, there is no simple answer.

When studying Pinker’s views on the development of children and parenting,  the three laws of behavioral genetics should be examined.  Although they are not totally accepted by most psychologists, they set a foundation for the argument of nature versus nurture.   
	
<i>The First Law:  All human behavioral traits are heritable.</i>
Behavioral traits are those traits that can be measured through psychological tests such as IQ tests and personality tests.
